    <h2>
      CHAPTER ONE&mdash;THE VILLAGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE MORNING A FEW
      MONTHS AGO A foreigner under the influence of an aeroplane descended
      somewhat hurriedly in a broad and&mdash;as he ascertained&mdash;a soft
      meadow in Nethershire; and while he was picking up his matches preparatory
      to lighting his cigarette&mdash;he has always a cigarette in his waistcoat
      pocket, for a man with a Kodak may be lurking behind the nearest tree&mdash;an
      agricultural labourer on his way to his work looked over the hedge at him.
      The foreign person noticed him, and after trying him in vain with German,
      French, and Hungarian, fell back upon English, and in the few words of
      that language which he knew, inquired the name of the place. &ldquo;Why, Bleybar
      Lane, to be sure,&rdquo; replied the man, perceiving the trend of the question
      with the quick intelligence of the agricultural labourer; and when the
      stranger shook his head and lapsed into Russian, begging him to be more
      precise (for the aviator had not altogether recovered from the daze of his
      sudden arrival), the man repeated the words in a louder tone, &ldquo;Bleybar
      Lane&mdash;everybody knows Bleybar Lane; and that's Thurswell that you
      can't see, beyond the windmill,&rdquo; and then walked on. Happily our parson,
      who had watched the descent of the stranger and was hastening to try if he
      could be of any help to him, came up at that moment and explained that he
      was in England, where English was, up to that time at least, spoken in
      preference to German or, indeed, any other language, and that breakfast
      would be ready at the Rectory in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0002" id="link2H_4_0002"> </a>
    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      I&mdash;THE ABORIGINES
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the Rector who told me the story, adding in regard to the labourer&mdash;&mdash;
      &ldquo;Isn't that just like Thurswell&mdash;fancying that a Czech who had just
      crossed the Channel, and believed himself to be in Belgium, should know
      all about Thurswell and its Bleybar Lane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought that it was very like Thurswell indeed, and afterwards I made it
      still more like by talking to the agricultural labourer himself about the
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, he spoke gibberish with a foreign accent, and I told him plain
      enough, when he had swept his arms and cried 'Where?' or words to that
      effect, that he was by Bleybar Lane, and that the place he couldn't see
      for the windmill was Thurswell; but it were no use: foreigners be in the
      main woeful ignorant for Christian persons, and I could see that he had no
      knowledge even of Thurswell when he heard the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0023.jpg" alt="0023 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0023.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      That is our village down to the ground. You could not persuade one of the
      aborigines that there is any place in England or outside it of greater
      importance than Thurswell, because there is no place of greater importance
      to the Thurswellian. An aged inhabitant was taken by his son to see the
      coronation procession, and when he was asked what it was like, replied,
      after a suitable pause, that it ran Thurs-well's Day very hard&mdash;Thurswell's
      Day is the name given to the First Sunday after Trinity, when the Free
      Foresters and Ancient Shepherds march to church in sashes, with a band
      made up of a fife, three flutes, a drum, a concertina, and a melodion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, neighbours, it ran Thurswell's Day hard,&rdquo; he affirmed, and did not
      flinch from his statement in spite of the incredulous murmur that arose
      from the bench nearest the door, which was immediately suppressed by the
      landlord, who was apprehensive of a riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thurswell is a village of antiquity. Its name occurs in <i>Domesday Book</i>,
      where you may look in vain for any mention of Brindlington, that mushroom
      town of 60.000 inhabitants, which is nine miles to the north, or even of
      Broadminster, the Cathedral town, which is seven miles to the west.
      &ldquo;Broadminster is where the Dean lives,&rdquo; I was told by the landlord of the
      Wheatsheaf at Thurswell when I was making inquiries about the district,
      &ldquo;and Brindlington is where the brewery is; but my father got his ale at
      Pipstone, and I get mine there too, though it's a blow to Brindlington,
      for in harvest the best part of a cask goes within a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are several other villages within a mile or so of Thurswell, and the
      inhabitants of some are infatuated enough to believe that they are on a
      social, as well as a commercial, level with the people of Thurswell. This
      singular hallucination caused a good deal of friction on all sides in
      years gone by, and <i>the rapprochement</i> that was eventually brought
      about between Thurswell and its neighbours by the thoughtfulness of a
      Rector, who preached a sermon on the vision of St. Peter and enjoined upon
      his hearers to remember that even though people have not been born in
      Thurswell they are still God's creatures, was a purely sentimental one,
      and did not last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years ago an article appeared in the <i>Topographical Gazette</i>
      from the pen of an eminent archaeologist affirming that Thurswell must
      originally have been Thor's Well, so that the place dated back to the time
      of the worship of the Scandinavian god Thor; but while this evidence of
      its antiquity was received by some of us with enthusiasm&mdash;having been
      a resident in the village for a whole year I was naturally an ardent
      Thurswellian&mdash;it was, when reproduced in the <i>East Nethershire
      Weekly</i>, generally regarded as the invention of some one anxious to
      give the enemies of the village some ground for their animosity toward it.
      For the suggestion that it had a heathen origin was not one, it was felt,
      to which its people could tamely submit. There was some talk of a public
      meeting to protest against the conclusions come to by the archaeologist,
      and the Rector was considered in some quarters to be but a half-hearted
      champion of the Faith when he refused to lend the schoolhouse&mdash;sixty
      people could be crowded into it&mdash;for this purpose, his argument that
      the more heathen Thurswell had been in the past, the more marked should be
      its display of the Christian virtue of charity in the present, being
      criticised as savouring of Jesuitry. For months the matter was the leading
      topic of the neighbourhood, and the Hearts of Oak Habitation of the
      Ancient Shepherds drew up a resolution protesting in this connection
      against &ldquo;archaeology and every form of idolatry.&rdquo; It was the misprint in
      the <i>Gazette</i> that changed &ldquo;Hearts of Oak&rdquo; into &ldquo;Heads of Oak&rdquo; in
      publishing the proceedings that quenched the violence of the discussion,
      and now it is considered bad taste to refer to it at all.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE CENTENARIANS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ore recently still
      another busybody endeavoured to deprive the village of the reputation
      which it had long enjoyed as the centre of English longevity. Now it would
      be impossible for any one to study the dates on the tombstones in the
      churchyard without noticing how great was the number of centenarians who
      died within the first fifty years of the nineteenth century in the parish
      of Thurswell. There were apparently eighteen men and fourteen women
      interred after passing their hundredth year; indeed, one woman was
      recorded to have reached her hundred and twenty-seventh year, which is a
      good age for a woman. The people were naturally very proud of the constant
      references made in print to their longevity; but one day there came down
      to the village a member of the Statistical Society, and after busying
      himself among the musty parish registers for a month, he announced his
      discovery that in every case but one the date of the birth of the alleged
      centenarians was the date of the birth of their parents. The investigator
      had noticed that all the alleged centenarians had &ldquo;departed this life&rdquo;
       during the rectorship of the Rev. Thomas Ticehurst, and centenarianism had
      always been his fad. He had preached sermon after sermon on Methuselah and
      other distinguished multi-centenarians, and he spent his time travelling
      about the country in search of evidence in confirmation of the theory that
      Methuselah, though somewhat beyond the average in respect of age, might
      yet have been exceeded on his own ground by many people living in the
      country districts of England. Nothing was easier, the investigator tried
      to show, than for a clergyman in charge of the registers, who had such a
      hobby, to assume, when any very old man or woman died in his parish, that
      he or she actually was twenty years or so older; and as the Christian
      names were nearly always hereditary, in nine cases out of ten he accepted
      the registry of the birth of the father as that of the lately deceased
      man, and the date of the birth of the mother in regard to the aged woman,
      the result being a series of the most interesting inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess that I myself felt that I had a personal grievance against
      this busybody statistician. There is nothing so comforting to the
      middle-aged as a stroll through a cemetery of centenarians; and I had the
      most uncharitable feelings against the person who could make such an
      attempt to deprive me of the pleasant hope of living another sixty or
      seventy years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while we were still talking about the danger of permitting strangers
      to have access to the registers, I was told one morning that a man who had
      once been the gardener at the place which I had just acquired would like
      to see me. Now, I had had already some traffic with the superannuated
      gardener of my predecessor, and so I was now surprised to find myself face
      to face with quite a different person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not the gardener here,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I saw him; his name is Craggs,
      and he still lives in the hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ay, Jonas Craggs&mdash;young Joe, we called him; I knew his father,&rdquo;
       replied my visitor. &ldquo;He was only here a matter of six-and-thirty years. I
      was superann'ated to make way for him. Young-Joe, we called him, and I was
      curious to see how things had come on in the garden of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were superannuated thirty-six years ago,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What age are you
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ninety-eight, sir,&rdquo; he replied with a smirk.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0008.jpg" alt="0008 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0008.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      I showed him round the garden. He said he could see that the things he had
      planted had grown summut; and I walked through the churchyard the next
      Sunday with the greatest complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told the Rector that my experience of this grand old gardener
      tended to make me take the side of Thurswell and the neighbourhood against
      scientific investigation in regard to longevity, he assured me that if I
      paid a visit to a certain elderly lady who lived with a middle-aged
      granddaughter in a cottage on the road to Cransdown I should find ample
      confirmation of the faith for which I had a leaning. The lady's name was,
      he said, Martha Trendall, and she really was, he thought, a genuine
      centenarian, for she had a vivid recollection of events which had happened
      quite ninety years ago; and, unlike most reputed centenarians, she
      remembered many details of the historical incidents that had taken place
      in her young days; she was a most intelligent person altogether, and had
      evidently been at one time a great reader, though latterly her eyesight
      had shown signs of failing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made up my mind to pay a visit to this Mrs. Trendall, and thought that
      perhaps I might get material for a letter to the <i>Times</i> that should
      not leave the scientific investigator a leg to stand on. A month, however,
      elapsed before I carried out my intention, though the Rector thought this
      was not a case for procrastination: when a lady is anything over a hundred
      her hold upon life shows a tendency to relax, he said, for even the most
      notorious centenarians cannot be expected to live for ever. But when I
      managed to make my call I must confess that I was amply repaid for the
      time I spent in the company of Mrs. Trendall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found her sitting in her chair in what is called the chimney corner when
      it exists in its original condition in a cottage, but is termed the &ldquo;ingle
      nook&rdquo; in those red brick imitation cottages which are being flung about
      the country by those architects who concern themselves in the development
      of estates. I saw at once that such a figure would be out of place
      anywhere except in the chimney corner of a cottage kitchen, with immovable
      windows, but a &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; iron crane for the swinging of pots over the
      hearth fire. The atmosphere&mdash;thanks to the immobile casements&mdash;was
      also all that it should be: it was congenially centenarian, I perceived in
      a moment. It had a pleasant pungency of old bacon, but though I looked
      about for a genuine flitch maturing in the smoke, I failed to see one&mdash;still,
      the nail on which it should be hanging was there all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was quite alert. There was nothing of the wheezy gammer
      about her. Only one ear was slightly deaf, she told me when I had been
      introduced by her granddaughter&mdash;a woman certainly over fifty. She
      smiled referring to her one infirmity, and when she smiled the parchment
      of her face became like the surface of the most ancient palimpsest: it was
      seamed by a thousand of the finest lines, and made me feel that I was
      looking at an original etching by Rembrandt or Albert Dürer&mdash;a &ldquo;trial
      proof,&rdquo; not evenly bitten in places; and the cap she wore added to the
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, I could see, what might be called a professional centenarian, and
      so might retain some of those prejudices which existed long ago against
      &ldquo;talking shop&rdquo; and therefore I refrained from referring in any way to her
      age: I felt sure that when the right moment came she would give me an
      opening, and I found that I had not misjudged her. I had scarcely told her
      how greatly we all liked our house before she gratified me by a
      reminiscence of the antepenultimate owner: he had died, I happen to know,
      thirty-eight years ago, and Mrs. Trendall remembered the morning he first
      rode his black horse to hounds&mdash;that was the year before he married,
      and his son was now a major-general. &ldquo;A long time ago,&rdquo; I remarked, and
      she smiled the patronising smile of the professional at the feeble effort
      of an incompetent amateur. &ldquo;Long ago? Oh no; only a bit over sixty years&mdash;maybe
      seventy.&rdquo; The difference between sixty and seventy years ago was in her
      eyes not worth taking any account of. Her treatment of this reminiscence
      gave me warning of what she could do when she had her second wind and got
      into her stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have a great memory, Mrs. Trendall,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;Was there much
      stir in this neighbourhood when Queen Victoria got married? I heard
      something about a big bonfire on Earl's Beacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twere no more'n a lucifer match in compare with the flare up after
      Waterloo,&rdquo; was her complacent reply; and I felt as if I had just had an
      audacious pawn taken by my opponent's Queen. &ldquo;Ay, Thurswell lost three
      fine youngsters at Waterloo. There was Amos Scovell, him with the red
      hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one they used to call Carrots?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same&mdash;Carrots they called him sure enough,&rdquo; she said,
      nodding. &ldquo;But you couldn't have knowed'un; you're no more'n a stripling as
      yet. Doan't you list to all that you hear from them that calls theirselves
      ancient old venerables; there's not a one of'un that's truthfully old&mdash;I'm
      the only one; take my word for it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her to understand (I hope) by my confidential smile and shake of
      the head that I was aware of the many fraudulent claims to longevity
      advanced by some of our friends about Thurswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Age? Age is an empty thing without a memory,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;But what a
      memory you have, Mrs. Trendall! I shouldn't wonder if you recollected the
      news of Nelson's victory at Trafalgar arriving in England&mdash;oh no:
      that was too long ago even for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bridled up in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too long ago for me?&mdash;too long, quotha! Don't I mind it as if it
      happened no earlier'n last week? It were before I married my first. It
      were my father that came a-bustling hasty like and wi' a face rosy wi'
      beer and hurry, and says he, 'Nelson has broke the Frenchies on us&mdash;broke
      them noble, and we may look for'un coming home any day now,' says he; and
      there wasn't a sober man in the five parishes that night&mdash;no, not a
      one. Ay, those was times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely&mdash;surely,&rdquo; I acquiesced. &ldquo;But now that you can look back on
      them quite calmly in the afternoon of your life, would you really say that
      they were more lively times than when the Duke of Marlborough was doing
      his fighting for us? You've heard your mother speak of Marlborough, I'm
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother&mdash;speak! Why, I see'un for myself wi' these very eyes when
      he come home from the wars&mdash;a nice, well-set-up gentleman, if so be
      that I know what'tis to be a gentleman. It was when he come to pay his
      respex to Squire Longden at Old Deane&mdash;the squire that married
      thrice, as they said, the first for love, the second for lucre, and the
      third for&mdash;for&mdash;now was it for liquor or learning?&mdash;Well,
      'twere one of the two. Ay, sir, those was the times&mdash;before there was
      any talk about Prince Albert and the Christian Palace in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather think so. And if you are old enough to remember seeing
      the great Duke of Marlborough, I am sure that you may remember seeing
      Oliver Cromwell when he came through Thurswell with his army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Cromwell? You've spoke the truth, sir. I see'un once&mdash;on'y
      once, to be exact. I mind'un well.'Twere in the mid o' hay harvest, and
      father come up to us in a mortial great haste, and says he, 'Martha lass,
      throw down that rake and I'll show you the greatest sight o' your life&mdash;Cromwell
      hisself on a mighty skewbald.' And, sure enough, there he was a-galloping
      at the head of a fine army o' men, with guns a-rumbling and the bugles
      blowing&mdash;grand as a circus&mdash;ay, Batty's Circus with all the fun
      about Jump Jim Crow and Billy Barlow and the rest. Oh, I saw'un sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Queen Elizabeth&mdash;I wonder if you ever chanced to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir&mdash;never! 'Twere always the sorrow o' my life that the day
      she passed through Ticebourne, where I was living with my grand-aunt
      Martha&mdash;her that I was named after&mdash;I had been sent with a
      basket o' three dozen eggs&mdash;one dozen of'em turkeys&mdash;to the big
      house, and her ladyship not being at home I had to wait the best part of a
      whole hour, and by the time I got back the Queen had driven away, so I
      missed the chance o' my life; for being since my early years noteworthy
      for speaking the truth to a hairs-breadth, I couldn't bring myself to say
      that I had seen a royal person when I hadn't. But what I can say is that I
      on'y missed seeing of her by twenty minutes, more or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel that I might be overwhelmed if I were borne much farther
      in the current of the pellucid stream of Mrs. Trendall's veracity; so I
      rose and thanked the good woman for her courtesy, and expressed the hope
      that the efforts she had made on my behalf to be rigidly accurate had not
      fatigued her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured me that all she had said was nothing to what she could say if
      I had a mind to listen to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I acknowledged to the Rector that the memory of Martha had surpassed
      my most sanguine hopes, he was greatly delighted. I thought it well,
      however, to neglect the opportunity he gave me of going into the details
      of her interesting recollections. Before we dropped the subject, he said
      what a pity it was that an historian of the nineteenth century could not
      avail himself of the services of Martha to keep him straight on some
      points that might be pronounced of a contentious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many days after my interesting interview with Martha, the professional
      centenarian, the decease of an unobtrusive amateur was notified to me. It
      came about through the temporary disorganisation of our bread service,
      which I learned was due to the sudden death of the baker's mother.
      Entering his shop a week or two later, I ventured to say a word of
      conventional condolence to him, and this was responded to by him with a
      mournful volubility that made me feel as if I had just attended a funeral
      oration, or an inefficient reading of &ldquo;In Memoriam.&rdquo; It was a terrible
      blow to him, he said&mdash;a cruel blow; and he went on to suggest that it
      was such an apparently gratuitous stroke that it made even the most
      orthodox man doubt the existence of mercy in the Hand that had inflicted
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; I acquiesced. &ldquo;But, after all, we must all die some
      day, Martin, and your good mother could scarcely be said to have been cut
      off long before she had reached the allotted span. You know you can hardly
      call yourself a young man still, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head as if to hint that he had heard this sort of thing
      before. I think it very probable that he had: I know that I had, more than
      once. But I thought that there was no occasion for him to suggest so much,
      so I boldly asked him what age his mother had reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, not laterally this time, but longitudinally, and
      distributing the flies more evenly over a plate of jam tarts with a
      mournful whisk of his feather duster, he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a hundred and four last February, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned right about and left him alone with his irreparable grief.

    <h2>
      III. THE POINT OF VIEW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the subject of
      age, I may say that it has always seemed to me that it is the aim of most
      people to appear as young as possible&mdash;and perhaps even more so&mdash;for
      as long as possible&mdash;and perhaps even longer; but then it seems
      gradually to dawn upon them that there may be as much distinction attached
      to age as to youth, and those who have been trying to pass themselves off
      as much younger than they really are turn their attention in the other
      direction and endeavour to make themselves out to be much older than the
      number of their years. It is, of course, chiefly in the cottages that the
      real veterans are to be found&mdash;old men and women who take a proper
      pride in having reached a great if somewhat indefinite age, and in holding
      in contempt the efforts of a neighbour to rival them in this way. One of
      the peculiarities of these good folk is to become hilarious over the news
      of the death of some contemporary. I have seen ancient men chuckle at the
      notion of their having survived some neighbour who, they averred with
      great emphasis, was much their junior. The idea seems to strike them as
      being highly humorous. And so perhaps it may be, humour being so highly
      dependent upon the standpoint from which it is viewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cottages the conversation frequently turns upon the probability of
      an aged inmate being gathered unto his fathers before next harvest or, if
      in autumn, before the first snow, and the utmost frankness characterises
      the remarks made on this subject in the presence of the person who might
      be supposed to be the most interested in the discussion, though, as a
      matter of fact, he is as little interested in it as the Tichborne claimant
      acknowledged he was in his trial after it had passed its fortieth day. I
      was fortunate enough to reach the shelter of a farm cottage before a great
      storm a few years ago, and on a truckle bed in the warm side of the living
      room of the family there lay an old man, who nodded to me and quavered out
      a &ldquo;good marn.&rdquo; I asked the woman, who was peeling potatoes sitting on a
      stool, if he was her father or her husband's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's Grandpaw Beck; but don't you take any heed o' him, sir, he's dying,&rdquo;
       she replied, with the utmost cheerfulness. &ldquo;Doctor's bin here yestereve,
      and says he'll be laid out afore a week. But we've everything handylike
      and ready for'un.&rdquo;

      She pointed to a chair on which some white garments were neatly laid. &ldquo;I
      run the iron o'er'em afore settin' to the bit o' dinner,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at the old man. He nodded his approval of her good housekeeping.
      He clearly thought that procrastination should be discountenanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flashes of lightning and the peals of thunder seemed to me to be by no
      means extravagant accompaniments to this grim scene (as it appeared in my
      eyes). I have certainly known far less impressive scenes on the stage
      thought worthy of the illumination of lightning and the punctuation of
      thunder claps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This familiar treatment of the subject of the coming of the grim figure
      with the scythe prevails in every direction. A friend of mine had a like
      experience in a cottage in another part of the country. The man of the
      house&mdash;he was a farm labourer&mdash;was about to emigrate to Canada,
      and was anxious to get as good a price as possible for some pieces of old
      china in his possession, and my friend had called to see them by
      invitation. He was brought into a bedroom where the plates were to be seen
      on a dresser; and by way of making conversation on entering the room, he
      asked the man when he thought of leaving England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very shortly now,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Just as soon as feyther there dies&rdquo;
       (jerking his head in the direction of a bed), &ldquo;and he's far gone&mdash;he's
      dying fast&mdash;Doctor Jaffray gives us great hope that a week'll
      finish'un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went on to talk about the china, explaining that three of the
      pieces had been brought by his grandmother from the Manor House, where she
      had been still-room maid for twenty-six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-eight years&mdash;twenty-eight years, Amos,&rdquo; came a correcting
      falsetto from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nowt o' the matter,&rdquo; cried the son. &ldquo;This is no business o'
      yours. We doan't want none o' your jaw. Go on wi' your dying.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;THE GENERAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N A VERY DIFFERENT
      PLANE OF INterest I regard my experience of two delightful old people whom
      I found living, the one a mile or two on the Brindlington side of
      Thurswell, the other on the Broadminster side, &ldquo;where the Dean lives.&rdquo; The
      former is an old general who once commanded a regiment of Sikhs and spent
      fifty years in India. He is now eighty-three years of age, and has two
      sons with the rank of colonel, a grandson who is a captain of Sappers, and
      two who are lieutenants in the navy. The old man has nothing of the
      bristling retired general about him&mdash;not even the liver. He is of a
      gentle, genial nature, not very anxious to hear the latest news, and not
      at all eager to make his visitors acquainted with his experiences in India
      or his views as to the exact degree of decadence reached by &ldquo;the sarvice.&rdquo;
       He speaks in a low and an almost apologetic tone, and is interested in old
      Oriental china and tortoiseshell tea-caddies. One could never believe that
      this was the man whose sobriquet of Shire-i-Iran (Lion of Persia) was once
      a household word along the turbulent northwest frontier, or that he had
      been the most brilliant exponent of all the dash which one associates with
      the cavalry leader. His reputation on that long frontier was that of an
      Oriental equivalent of the Wild Huntsman of the German ballad. People had
      visions of him galloping by night at the head of his splendid Sikhs to cut
      off the latest fanatical insurrectionary from his supports, and then sweep
      him and his marauders off the face of the earth. Certainly no cavalry
      leader ever handled his men with that daring which he displayed&mdash;a
      daring that would have deserved to be called recklessness had it once
      failed.... And there he sat at dinner, talking in his low voice about the
      fluted rim of one of his tea-caddies, and explaining how it was quite
      possible to repair the silver stringing that beautified the top. Once I
      fancied I overheard him telling the person who sat by him at dinner about
      the native regiments&mdash;I felt sure that I heard the word &ldquo;Sepoy,&rdquo; and
      I became alert. Alas! the word that I had caught was only &ldquo;tea-poy&rdquo;&mdash;he
      was telling how he had got a finely cut glass for a deficient caddie out
      of an old nineteenth-century mahogany tea-poy. That was the nearest
      approach he made to the days of his greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I noticed with satisfaction that he partook of every dish that was
      offered to him&mdash;down to the marmalade pudding. At dessert he glanced
      down the table and said that he thought he would have an apple. &ldquo;No,
      dear,&rdquo; said his daughter, gently but firmly removing the dish beyond his
      reach. &ldquo;You know that you are not allowed to touch apples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what harm will an apple do me&mdash;just one&mdash;only one apple?&rdquo;
       he inquired, and there were tears in his voice&mdash;it had become a
      tremulous pipe, the tone of a child whose treat had been unjustly
      curtailed. &ldquo;No, dear, not even one. It is for your own good: you should
      have an apple if it agreed with you; but it doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want an apple&mdash;I can't see what harm an apple would do me,&rdquo; he
      cried again. But his daughter was firm. It was very pathetic to witness
      the scene. The Lion of Persia becoming plaintive at being denied a
      rosy-cheeked apple. The man who, with a force of only six hundred sabres
      behind him, had ridden up to Mir Ali Singh with the three thousand rebels
      supporting him, and demanded his sword, and got it, not being able to get
      his apple when he had asked for it nicely, seemed to me to be a most
      pathetic figure. I pleaded for him as one pleads for a child in the
      nursery: he had been a good boy and had eaten all that had been set before
      him quite nicely&mdash;why might he not have an apple to make him happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the daughter was inexorable. She told me that I did not know her
      father, while she did. An apple would be poison to him; and so the old
      hero was left complaining, with an occasional falsetto note, upon the
      restrictions of his commissariat. I am pretty sure that there was no
      falsetto note in any of his complaints in regard to commissariat forty
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a noble old warrior, however, for when his daughter had, with the
      rest of the ladies, left us after dinner, he never put out a hand to the
      apple dish, though there was no man at the table who would have interfered
      with him had he done so; the Newtown Pippins remained blushing, but not on
      account of any disloyalty on his part to the duty he owed to the daughter
      who had his welfare at heart.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE DEAR OLD LADY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he aged lady who
      lives in a lovely old moated house a few miles out of Thurswell is one of
      the youngest people I ever met. She is the mother of two distinguished
      sons and the grandmother of a peeress. She takes an interest in everything
      that is going on in various parts of the world, and even points out the
      mistakes made by the leader-writers in the London papers&mdash;some of the
      mistakes. But she does so quite cheerfully and without any animus. She
      still sketches <i>en plein air</i>, and in her drawings there is no
      suggestion of the drawing-master of the early Victorians. Any elderly
      person who could hold a pencil and whose moral character could bear a
      strict investigation was accounted competent to teach drawing in those
      days; for drawing in those days meant nothing beyond making a fair copy of
      a lithograph of a cottage in a wood with a ladder leaning against a gable
      and a child sitting on a fence&mdash;a possible successful statesman in
      the future&mdash;with a dog below him. She never was so taught, she told
      me: she had always held out against the restrictions of the schoolroom of
      her young days, and had never played either the &ldquo;Maiden's Prayer&rdquo; or the
      &ldquo;Battle of Prague.&rdquo; Thalberg's variations on &ldquo;Home Sweet Home&rdquo; she had
      been compelled to learn. No young lady in that era of young ladies could
      avoid acquiring at least the skeleton of Thalberg's masterpiece: and I was
      glad that this particular old lady, who had once been a young lady, had
      mastered it; for it enabled her to give me the most delightful parody upon
      it that could be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once did I hear her speak with bitterness in referring to any one;
      but when she began upon this occasion, she spoke not only bitterly, but
      wrathfully&mdash;contemptuously as well. She was referring to the Emperor
      Napoleon III. in his relations with the unhappy Maximilian of Mexico. She
      had known the latter intimately. My own impression is that she had been in
      love with him&mdash;and tears were in her eyes when she talked of how he
      had been betrayed by the man whom she called a contemptible little cad.
      Sedan represented, in her way of thinking, the cordial agreement with her
      views by the Powers above. To hear her talk of those tragedies of more
      than forty years ago, as if they were the incidents of the day before
      yesterday, was inspiriting. I never inquired what was her age, but one
      afternoon when I called upon her I found that a birthday party was going
      on&mdash;a double party; for it was her birthday as well as her youngest
      grandchild's. Two fully iced cakes, with pink and white complexions, were
      being illuminated in the customary way, and each had been made a
      candelabrum of eight tapers. When I ventured to suggest that there must be
      an error in computation in some direction, it was the younger of the
      beneficiaries who explained to me that about seventy years or so ago
      Granny had become too old to allow of her birthday cake holding the full
      amount of the candles to which she was entitled, so it had been agreed
      that she should have only one candle for every ten years of her life. The
      little girl confided in me that she thought it was rather a shame to cheat
      poor Granny out of her rights, but of course there was no help for it: any
      one could see that no cake could be made large enough to accommodate,
      without undue crowding, eighty-one candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the sweet old Granny, and thought, for some reason or other,
      of the night of the first January of the century when I had stood
      listening to the tolling of the eighty-one strokes of the church bell in
      Devonshire, when every belfry in the kingdom announced the age of the good
      Queen who had gone to her rest. I wondered...
    </p>
    <p>
      This dear lady of the eight-candle birthday cake&mdash;of which, by the
      bye, she partook heartily and apparently without the least misgiving&mdash;had
      been married at the age of seventeen, and this, she thought, was exactly
      the right age for a girl to marry, not, as might be supposed, because it
      admitted of her period of repentance being so much the longer, but simply
      because she considered grandchildren so interesting. She was not inclined
      to be tolerant over the prudent marriages of the present day, when no girl
      is unreasonable enough to expect a proposal before she is twenty-five, or
      from a man who is less than thirty-five. It almost brought me back to
      Shakespeare's England to hear her express such opinions. That stately old
      lady, Juliet's mother, as she appears in every modern production of the
      play, was made by the author to be something between twenty-six and
      twenty-seven, her daughter being some months under fourteen, but certainly
      forward for her age. We used to be informed by sage critics of this drama
      &ldquo;of utter love defeated utterly&rdquo; that Shakespeare made Juliet so young
      because it was the custom in Italy, where girls developed into womanhood
      at a much earlier age than in England, for a girl to marry at Juliet's
      time of life. It so happens, however, that early marriage was the custom
      in England and not in Italy in the sixteenth century. When a girl was
      twelve her parents looked about for a promising husband for her, and
      usually found one when she was thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few months ago I came upon an unpublished letter, written in the
      beautiful Gothic hand of Queen Elizabeth, in response to the inquiry of an
      ambassador respecting a wife for an amiable young prince. The Queen
      suggested two names of highly eligible young women, and mentioned that one
      of them was twelve and the other thirteen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The most flagrant example of unbridled centenarianism which I have yet
      come across in the course of my investigations in the neighbourhood of
      Thurswell was that of a lady who had won quite a literary aureole for her
      silver hair owing to the accident of her being actually the original
      &ldquo;Cousin Amy&rdquo; of Tennyson's &ldquo;Locksley Hall.&rdquo; For years she had worn this
      honourable distinction, and, so far as I could gather, her title to it had
      never been disputed. Even in the Cathedral Close of Broadminster the
      tradition had been accepted, and she had been pointed out to strangers,
      who doubtless looked at her with interest, saying, &ldquo;Not really!&rdquo; or &ldquo;How
      perfectly sweet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to ask the prebendary who had told me that the poet had been in
      love with her and consequently &ldquo;greatly cut up&rdquo; when she married some one
      else&mdash;as might be inferred from some passages in the poem&mdash;what
      was the present age of the lady, and he assured me that she was
      seventy-four. She did not look it, but she really was seventy-four. I had
      not the heart to point out that twenty-three years had elapsed since
      Tennyson published his sequel&mdash;&ldquo;Sixty Years After&rdquo;&mdash;to his
      &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; so that this &ldquo;Cousin Amy&rdquo; must be at least a centenarian
      if she had not died, as described in the sequel, between eighty and ninety
      years ago. She was, however, a nice old lady and her name was really Amy,
      and she had known Alfred Tennyson when she had been very young and he a
      middle-aged gentleman whom it was a great privilege to know.

      I.&mdash;THE PILLARS OF SOCIETY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HURSWELL IS
      UNDOUBTEDLY AN IDeal English village situated in the midst of an
      agricultural county, and far away from the unhealthy and demoralising
      influences of trade. It prides itself on being &ldquo;select&rdquo;&mdash;so does
      every other English village, even when it lies deep embowered among the
      striking scenery of a coal-mining district. But Thurswell is really
      &ldquo;select.&rdquo; A strange family may come to one of the best houses&mdash;one of
      the four or five that have entrance gates with lodges and carriage drives&mdash;and
      yet remain absolutely ignored by the older residents. Of course the
      shopkeepers pay the newcomers some little attention, and the ladies who
      collect for the various charities and the various churches are quite
      polite in making early calls; but the question of calling formally and
      leaving cards simply because the people are newcomers, requires to be
      thoroughly threshed out before it is followed by any active movement on
      the part of the senior residents. It has been called unsocial on this
      account; but everybody in the world&mdash;at least, everybody in Thurswell&mdash;knows
      that to be called unsocial is only another way of being called select The
      Rector must pronounce an opinion on the strangers, and&mdash;more
      important still&mdash;the Rector's wife. The example of the
      Barnaby-Granges, who have lived for centuries at the Moated Manor House,
      must be observed for what it is worth. It is understood that people like
      the Barnaby-Granges may call upon strangers out of a sense of duty; but
      every one knows how far astray from the path trod by the &ldquo;select&rdquo; a sense
      of duty may lead one, so that the fact of the Manor House people having
      called upon the newcomer is not invariably regarded as conferring upon the
      latter the privilege of a passport to the most representative Society at
      Thurswell. The strangers must wait until Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer have
      decided whether they are to be called on or ignored. Mrs. Lingard is the
      widow of a captain of Sappers, and Miss Mercer is the middle-aged daughter
      of a previous rector, and for years these ladies have assumed the right of
      veto in respect of the question of calling upon newcomers. Within the past
      year, however, this question, it should be mentioned, has developed
      certain complications, owing to the strained relations existing between
      the two ladies. Previously they formed a sort of vigilance committee to
      determine what should be done, but since the breaking off of diplomatic
      relations between them the poor people who had previously looked to them
      jointly for guidance are now compelled to consult them severally as to the
      course they mean to pursue, and all this takes time, and the loss of time
      in the etiquette of first calls may be construed into actual rudeness by
      sensitive people.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is how we stand at present; and although many well-meaning persons&mdash;not
      invariably belonging to clerical circles&mdash;have endeavoured to bring
      about a <i>rapprochement</i> for the good of the whole community between
      Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer, hitherto every effort of the kind has
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the particulars of the incident that brought about the friction
      between the two ladies are known, it will easily be understood that a
      restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> is not to be accomplished in a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all due to the exceptionally dry summer. People who retain only the
      pleasantest recollections of that season of sunlight and balmy breezes
      will probably find reason to modify their views respecting it when they
      hear how it led to the shattering of an old friendship and, incidentally,
      to the complication of the most important social question that can come
      before such a community as is represented by Thurs-well.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he facts of the
      matter are simple enough in their way. Each of the ladies occupies a small
      house of her own, fully, and not semi-detached, with a small patch of
      green in front and a small garden at the back; but the combined needs of
      front and back are not considered sufficiently great to take up all the
      time of a gardener working six days in the week during the summer. There
      is enough work, however, to take up three days of the six, with
      window-cleaning thrown in, in slack seasons. As the conditions of labour
      are identical in the case of the gardens of both ladies&mdash;only Miss
      Mercer throws in the washing of her pug to balance Mrs. Lingard's
      window-cleaning&mdash;John Bingham, the jobbing gardener of Thurswell,
      suggested several years ago that he should divide his time between the two
      gardens, and this plan, to all appearances, worked very satisfactorily in
      regard to every one concerned.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Only John Bingham was aware of the trouble involved in keeping both
      gardens on precisely the same level of &ldquo;getting on&rdquo;&mdash;only John
      Bingham was aware of the difficulty of preventing either of the ladies
      from seeing that anything in the garden of the other was &ldquo;getting on&rdquo;
       better than the same thing in her own patch. It might have been fancied
      that as they were in complete agreement respecting the necessity for a
      strict censorship upon the visiting lists of the neighbourhood as regards
      strangers, there could not possibly exist any rivalry between them on so
      insignificant a matter as the growth of a petunia or the campanile of a
      campanula; but John Bingham knew better. It had been his task year by year
      to minimise to the one lady his success with the garden of the other&mdash;to
      say a word of disparagement on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays of all
      that he had been praising on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. But
      sometimes Nature is stronger even than her greatest enemy, a jobbing
      gardener, and so it was that when Mrs. Lingard chanced to pay a visit to
      Miss Mercer on a Thursday, she found the garden of the latter, just
      recovering from the hand of John Bingham's attention on the Monday,
      Tuesday, and Wednesday, obviously superior in some respects to her own,
      and John found his diplomatic resources quite unable to meet with the
      demand for an explanation when she got home. It was in vain that he tried
      to make her understand, what she certainly should have known already from
      her experience of the ministrations of John&mdash;namely, that not he, but
      the superior soil and aspect of Miss Mercer's herbaceous border, should be
      regarded accountable for the marvellous growths which had attracted her
      attention in the garden of her rival. His Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
      patron declared herself far from satisfied with such an explanation. Soil!
      Had she ever shown herself to be close-fisted in the matter of soil? she
      inquired. And as for aspect&mdash;had he not chosen the aspect of the
      herbaceous border at which he was now working? No, she knew very well, she
      affirmed, that what made a garden beautiful was loving care. She professed
      herself unable to understand why John should lavish all his affection upon
      Miss Mercer's border rather than upon her own; all that she could do was
      to judge by results, and, viewed from this basis, it could not but be
      apparent to every unprejudiced observer that he had been giving Miss
      Mercer's borders such loving touches as he had never bestowed upon her
      own: the flowers spoke for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had heard of the Language of Flowers, but he had never mastered the
      elements of their speech. As a matter of fact, he took no interest in
      flowers or their habits. He had &ldquo;dratted&rdquo; them times without number for
      their failure to do all that the illustrated catalogues declared they
      would do, and now he found reason to drat those of Miss Mercer for having
      done much more than he had meant them to do. It was with a view to restore
      the balance of mediocrity between the gardens, which had been through no
      fault of his, disturbed by a sudden outbreak of &ldquo;Blushing Brides&rdquo; in Miss
      Mercer's parterre, that he gave some extra waterings to Mrs. Lingard's
      verbinas, trusting to convince her that he was a thoroughly disinterested
      operator in both the gardens&mdash;which was certainly a fact. But in that
      arid summer the response of the verbinas was but too rapid, and Miss
      Mercer, calling upon her friend (and rival), was shown the bed with the
      same pride that she had displayed when exhibiting her petunias.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing&mdash;the day was Saturday&mdash;but she perceived, with
      that unerring intuition which in some persons almost takes the place of
      genius, that petunias had been supplanted (literally) by verbinas in the
      affections of John Bingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the Sunday rehearsing an interview which she had arranged in her
      mind to have with John Bingham when he should arrive the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Monday came, and John Bingham failed to arrive. She waited at the back
      entrance to the garden until ten o'clock, but still he did not appear.
      Then she sent a messenger to his cottage to inquire the cause of his
      absence. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were her days for his services,
      and never once had he failed her. She could not guess what was the matter.
      She had always regarded him as a sober man and one for whom Monday morning
      had no terrors. The mystery of his first failure was rendered all the more
      unfathomable when the tweeny maid returned saying that Mrs. Bingham had
      told her positive that John had gone out to work as usual that same
      morning, and that Mrs. Bingham had taken it for granted that he was in
      Miss Mercer's garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a quarter of an hour Miss Mercer pondered over the whole incident, and
      then she suddenly put on another hat, discarding the garden specimen with
      which she had begun the day, and went down the road and round by the
      Moated Manor House to where Mrs. Lingard's villa was situated, just beyond
      the knoll of elms. The hall door was wide open to the morning air, and
      through the glass door at the farther end of the hall she distinctly saw
      Mrs. Lingard standing on the edge of one of the beds of the garden with
      John Bingham kneeling at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this on a Monday morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      John Bingham had actually attended morning ser-vice in the church the day
      before&mdash;Miss Mercer had seen him there&mdash;and yet on Monday he had
      broken faith with her, and now, at ten-thirty, he was engaged in planting
      out the contents of the capacious basket which Mrs. Lingard was doling out
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Lingard was wearing her garden hat just as if the day was
      Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, when she was entitled to his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Lingard had also been at church the previous day and had repeated
      the responses in her ordinary tone of voice, and without faltering, though
      beyond a doubt her heart had been full of this scheme of suborning a
      faithful, if somewhat weak, servant from his allegiance to the mistress
      who had an undisputed claim to his services the next day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment's hesitation Miss Mercer passed into the hall, opened the
      glass door beyond, and stood beside the guilty pair before either of them
      was aware of her presence. She saw that the man was planting asters&mdash;the
      finest aster cuttings she had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Bingham, are you aware that this is Monday morning?&rdquo; she said in an
      accusing voice, and so suddenly that a cry of surprise&mdash;it may have
      been with guilt&mdash;came from Mrs. Lingard, and John Bingham let drop
      his trowel and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Lucy! Where did you drop from without warning?&rdquo; cried the
      lady in the garden hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am addressing John Bingham, madam,&rdquo; said Miss Mercer in icy tones. &ldquo;And
      once again I ask John Bingham what he means by being here when his place
      should be in my garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can easily explain, my good woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lingard, lapsing, under
      the &ldquo;madam&rdquo; of the other, into the tone of voice she had found effective
      with the native servants in the West Indian island of St. Lucia when her
      husband had been stationed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not addressing you, madam,&rdquo; said Miss Mercer hotly: her glacial
      period had passed and had given place to the volcanic&mdash;the suppressed
      volcanic. &ldquo;I wish to be informed why this man&mdash;this traitor&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a greater fool than you are by nature, my good creature,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Lingard. &ldquo;But I might have known that you could be disagreeable over
      even such a trifle as my sending to John Bingham to assist me for an hour
      in planting out the asters which were only delivered this morning when
      they should have been here on Saturday. If I had not begged him to come to
      my help for a couple of hours the lot would have been spoiled. In justice
      to him I will say that he was very unwilling to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does that mean, pray?&rdquo; asked Miss Mercer sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that he knew you better than I did,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Lingard. &ldquo;He
      has had more experience of your narrow-mindedness than I have had. Now, go
      on with your work, John. Don't mind her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John did not go on with his work. He touched his forehead with the
      drooping aster that he held rather limply, saying, in the direction of
      Miss Mercer&mdash;&ldquo;I can easy make up the extra however, ma'am&mdash;mortal
      easy, in the evenin', and so I thought or I wouldn't be here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, let that satisfy you, make your mind easy; you'll not be defrauded
      of the shilling for his two hours,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lingard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be good enough to dictate to your inferiors, if such exist,
      madam; you need not dictate to me. You may keep your John Bingham now that
      you have him; I have made other arrangements for the future of my garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned with a mock courtesy. Mrs. Lingard also turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy Mercer, go back to your&mdash;your&mdash;your hen-run,&rdquo; she cried,
      pointing dramatically to the place of exit. &ldquo;Go on with your work, John
      Bingham. Mrs. Hopewell will only be too glad to take on your Thursdays,
      Fridays, and Saturdays. <i>She</i> has a garden&mdash;<i>a garden</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is the true and circumstantial account of how Mrs. Lingard and Miss
      Mercer ceased to be on speaking terms, and that is how it is that many
      people are becoming more hopeful of the future of Thurswell as the centre
      of a social neighbourhood. Each lady still arrogates to herself the right
      of veto in respect of the claims of any strange family to be visited on
      taking up their residence within reasonable visiting distance of
      Thurswell; but the people who formerly had been ready to accept the dictum
      of the two in such social matters are now beginning not only to assert
      their own independence of action, but even to dictate to others on all
      points on which they themselves had been dictated to&mdash;in no mild way&mdash;by
      Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer. But a mistake that was recently made by one
      of these immature dictators has done much to chasten their longing to take
      up the responsibilities attached to such a position. She had spoken with
      that definiteness which marks the amateur on the subject of the visiting
      of a certain Mrs. Judson Hyphen Marks who had taken Higham Lodge for a
      year, and accordingly quite a number of people left cards upon her. But
      suddenly the name of Judson Hyphen Marks appeared rather prominently in
      the columns devoted to the Law Court proceedings in the daily papers, and
      some curious information respecting the <i>ménage</i> of the Judson Hyphen
      Marks was brought under the notice of the people of Thurswell and, indeed,
      of England generally; and those who had left cards upon them consulted
      together as to whether it was possible or not for them to ask for their
      cards to be returned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general opinion that prevailed after several long discussions on this
      question was that no social machinery existed by which so desirable an
      object might be effected, and no move was made in that direction; but ever
      afterward the dictation of the feeble amateur who thought to take the
      social reins out of the hands of Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer when it was
      found that they were pulling them in opposite directions, threatening to
      upset the social apple-cart, was received for what it was worth, not for
      what it claimed to be worth.

      III.&mdash;FLOWERS AND FRIENDSHIPS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he instance just
      recorded of horticulture playing a prominent part in the breaking up of
      friendships is by no means unique. When one comes to think of it, one
      cannot be surprised that as the earliest serious quarrel recorded in the
      history of the world was over a purely horticultural question&mdash;namely,
      whether or not the qualities of beneficent nutrition attributed to a
      certain fruit had been accurately analysed&mdash;there should be many
      differences of opinion among the best of friends on the same subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my old gardener&mdash;not-the oldest of all, but the second oldest&mdash;who
      told me how it was that the annual prize given by the Moated Manor House
      people for the best floral display of the cottage order was very nearly
      withdrawn for ever, owing to the bad blood that was made by the award, no
      matter in what direction it was made. It seemed that the prize-winner
      invariably found himself compelled to accept the challenge to fight of all
      the disappointed aspirants to the prize, and before nightfall there was a
      general distribution of black eyes and front teeth; in some cases both got
      inextricably mixed up, and this was no pleasure to anybody, my informant
      assured me, and the wives of the men who were keen to compete for the
      prize discouraged them from it, with the warning that if they continued to
      spend their time over the cultivation of the blooms they might some day
      actually find themselves awarded the prize. That warning, founded as it
      was upon sound sense and reason, was beginning to produce its effects upon
      the better class of flower growers; but there were still a number of young
      fellows who went into training at the punch ball at the Church Institute
      club-room the day they sowed their flower seeds, and so were at the top of
      their form when the award was made in the early autumn, so that if one of
      them got the prize he thought if a pity that his training and practice at
      the punch ball should be wasted, and thus he was ready to prove to all
      disputants that the prize had gone to the best man; while it was only to
      be expected that those who had only had the cold consolation of honorary
      mention were only too ready to dispute his ability to maintain such an
      attitude for any length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this joint cultivation of bulbs and biceps was not just what
      the givers of the prize intended to achieve, and twice, when there had
      been arrests and summonses to petty sessions, a formal warning was issued
      to all whom it might concern that if the connection between the two
      cultures were not severed, the prize, which was only meant for success in
      the one, would be withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, however, it was not found necessary to enforce this ultimatum,
      and a <i>modus vivendi,</i> founded upon one which had been understood to
      work very satisfactorily in the case of the Chrysanthemum Society of
      Mallingham, was adopted, and up to the present this had made for peace.
      The annual Battle of Flowers at Thurswell has become a thing of the past,
      and &ldquo;Midge&rdquo; Purcell, the ex-lightweight champion of the county, who rents
      the Lion and Lamb Inn, and to whom the candidates for the prize applied
      for advice on the biceps side of the joint contest, affirms with regret
      that Englishmen are becoming degenerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a peace-loving florist at Mallingham, the honorary secretary to the
      Chrysanthemum Society, who explained the system upon which his committee
      had agreed to make their awards, and urged its adoption by the Thurswell
      people. Its operation was not intricate. Its fundamental principle may
      best be defined on the analogy of the rotation of crops as the rotation of
      awards. Like the award of the Garter, merit had nothing to do with its
      scheme. The prizes were awarded strictly in turn to the professional
      competitors&mdash;the others did not matter. Mr. Johnson got the
      chrysanthemum cup one year, Mr. Thompson the medal for the best twelve cut
      lilies, Mr. Cardwell the Malmaison salver, and Mr. Prior the vase for the
      best display of greenhouse ferns. The next year it was arranged that the
      vase should go to Mr. Johnson, the salver to Mr. Thompson, and so forth.
      By the adoption of this admirable plan the judges were saved a large
      amount of trouble, and there never was any friction between the
      competitors, for it was understood that if it was Prior's year for the
      lily medal, but he had a liking for any other prize, he could nearly
      always negotiate an exchange with the man whose turn had come for the
      award that he fancied. This principle of give and take, live and let live,
      had made the Mallingham Society one of the most popular floricultural
      organisations in the country, and its adoption by the Thurswell Committee
      of the Manor House prize brought about, as has been said, an entire
      cessation of that ill-feeling which led to the use of language that was
      certainly not the language of flowers, and to many-discreditable scenes
      even when there were no arrests made. The cause of peace has triumphed,
      though some people say that floriculture languishes through the lack of
      heal thy rivalry; for when every man is certain of the prize when his turn
      comes for it, he does not trouble about the flowers. There may be
      something in this suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking one consideration with another, it really does seem a pity that the
      rotation system is not more widely accepted by those societies which have
      been established for the encouragement of sundry excellent objects, such
      as the breeding of bull-dogs (for symbolic purposes), of pugs (of no use
      to any one when they are bred), of pigs (of which the prize-winner is
      invariably the most uneatable), and of pets (in various forms). In our
      neighbourhood such organisations are to be numbered by the dozen, and
      after every prize distribution the air is murmurous with the complaints of
      disappointed competitors. It was a shrewd farmer who suggested to me the
      principle on which the awards are made at our local dog show. &ldquo;The reason
      why there's so much grumbling, sir, is because the judges look at the
      wrong end of the leash,&rdquo; he said, and I understood what he meant.

      I know that the impression is very general that the pedigree of the
      exhibitor rather than that of the exhibit influences the local judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must confess that I could not bring myself to sympathise with one of
      our new residents who, after living in London all his life, bought Harley
      Croft House, a 40 h.p. motor-car and six pairs of gaiters, and set up as a
      country gentleman. It must be acknowledged that at times he looked a
      colourable imitation of one. He hoped that his starting of the breeding of
      cattle and fowl would consolidate his position. But his researches in the
      literature of both subjects at the same time resulted in some confusion.
      Of course his pointing out some drab-tinted cows to the steward of the
      Manor and alluding to them definitely as Buff Orpingtons was a slip that
      any one might make; but to hope to win sympathy for a wrong done to him by
      the judges at the poultry show by affirming that his bantam cock was
      really twice the size of the one to which the prize had been awarded was,
      I think, a strategical mistake of a flagrant character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more in the spirit of the country gentleman was the remark made to me
      by a neighbour who hunts five days a week in winter and talks about
      hunting seven days a week in the summer, on a purely literary subject. He
      had been at the Military Tournament in London the year that <i>The
      Merchant of Venice</i> was being played at Her Majesty's Theatre, and he
      confided in me that he thought on the whole it was very fine indeed,
      though for his part he enjoyed <i>The Runaway Girl</i> at the Gaiety more
      fully. He could not quite understand the point of some of the jokes in <i>The
      Merchant of Venice</i>, he said. For instance, he should like to know what
      there was to laugh at in the chap's saying to the Jew that some one had
      shown him a turquoise which he had bought from the Jew's daughter for a
      monkey. Any one who knew anything about precious stones knew that to pay a
      monkey for a single turquoise, even though set in an 18-carat ring, was to
      pay a fair price. Of course you couldn't get much of a diamond ring for
      twenty-five pounds; but you could get a first-rate turquoise for half the
      money. But there were some people, he knew, who would laugh at any joke if
      they were only told it was in a play of Shakespeare's. I agreed with him,
      and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not the sort of man who would make a fool of himself over Buff
      Orpingtons or cherish his bantams in proportion to their size and weight.

      I.&mdash;LESSEES FROM THE MIDLANDS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS THE
      REPRESENTATIVE OF THE second generation of one of the shirt-sleeves
      families of the midlands who took a lease of Nethershire Castle, the
      finest mansion in our neighbourhood. The Court of Chancery had decreed
      that it might be let for a term of years, the length of which was fixed by
      certain Commissioners in Lunacy, for Sir Ralph Richards had been in the
      care of a specialist in mental diseases for a long time, and it was
      understood that there were little hopes of his ever being able to enjoy
      his own again. Higgins was the name of the lessee from the north, and with
      his wife and family he had occupied the Castle for close upon ten years.
      He was a simple enough man as regards his tastes: he could not appreciate
      the beauty of the cedar wood ceiling of the banqueting hall or the
      Renaissance carved panels of the library. The splendid Gainsboroughs and
      Romneys of the Long Gallery made no more appeal to him than did the Van
      Dycks in the great hall or the three Fragonards of the drawing-room. He
      was quite satisfied with the reputation of having sufficient money to pay
      for the privilege of living in the midst of these masterpieces and of
      keeping about an acre and a half of roof in good repair: he knew more
      about the advantages of close-fitting slates than of the methods of
      eighteenth-century English artists or of fifteenth-century Italian
      carvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, however, valued to the full the artistic privileges of living in
      so splendid a house, and she was not one to shrink before the searching
      glances of Frances Anne, the wife of the first baronet of the house of
      Richards, as painted by Sir Joshua, sacrificing to Venus, or to assume
      that Lady Elizabeth had turned aside from making a libation to Hymen&mdash;Hymen
      demanded quite as many sacrifices as Venus on eighteenth-century canvases&mdash;to
      ask her what right she had to sit in the seats of the Richards of
      Nethershire Castle. She knew what her husband paid in the way of rent, and
      she felt that the same was large enough to avert from her any indignant
      look that a sentimentalist might imagine on the face of the most
      malevolent family portrait. In fact, Mrs. Higgins considered the sum large
      enough to allow of her assuming the attitude of the patroness in regard to
      the pictures: she had actually been heard by a friend of the Richards to
      express a critical opinion respecting the pose of the daughter of the
      second baronet&mdash;the one who became well known as the Countess of
      Avonwater&mdash;in Romney's picture of her as Circe, and to suggest that
      the charger of Lieut.-Colonel Jack Churchill Richards&mdash;he was called
      after his father's great commander&mdash;in the picture by Sir Godfrey
      Kneller was scarcely large enough to make a polo pony. It was, however,
      clearly understood that these criticisms were offered by the lady only by
      way of establishing her rights over the contents of the mansion so long as
      her husband paid so handsomely as he did for the privilege of such an
      entourage. She had probably heard of certain rights-of-way being
      maintained by a formal walking over the ground to which they referred, by
      the claimant, once a year, and so she thought it well to walk over the
      pictures, so to speak, now and again to show that she understood the
      rights of her position. She really felt the greatest pride in everything,
      and in the course of a few years her feeling in regard to them was that of
      a conscientious descendant from illustrious ancestors. She was much
      prouder of them than the modern Major-General in <i>Patience</i> was of
      his ancestors acquired by purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit that I paid to the Castle in the temporary possession of the
      family of Higgins was illuminating. I went not because I had ever met
      either Mr. or Mrs. Higgins, but because I was acquainted with Miss
      Richards, a charming old lady who was the sister of the unhappy baronet,
      and had been born in the Castle and lived there for twenty-five or thirty
      years, only leaving for the dower-house on the death of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Richards was on the friendliest terms with the tenants of her old
      home, and I could see that they were pleased to welcome all the friends
      whom she might bring with her to see the wonders of the Castle. But it was
      Mrs. Higgins who &ldquo;did the honours&rdquo; of the picture gallery, when we went
      thitherward after tea one lovely afternoon in sum mer shortly after I had
      come to Thurswell. It was Mrs. Higgins who assumed the rôle of Cicerone
      and told me all about the pictures, and gave me duodecimo biographies of
      the originals with all the familiarity that one would expect only from a
      member of the family. Miss Richards stood by smiling quite pleasantly,
      even when Mrs. Higgins looked at her, saying something about a pink-coated
      Captain Richards by Raeburn, and I was disposed to laugh at the comedy of
      Mrs. Higgins of Lancashire telling Miss Richards of Nethershire something
      confidential about Captain Richards, her great-granduncle!
    </p>
    <p>
      I admired the picture, but not nearly so much as I did the coolness of
      Mrs. Higgins and the kindly toleration of Miss Richards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the portrait by Thornhill of Miss Esther Richards, who
      afterwards married General Forster, who took part in the American War, and
      to avenge the murder of poor André&mdash;he called it murder, though, of
      course, some people think that André was really a spy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Higgins.
      &ldquo;Doesn't it seem strange to think of that sweet little girl-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pardon me,&rdquo; cried Miss Richards, &ldquo;you are not quite right. That is
      Lotitia Richards by North-cote. She married Sir Charles Brewster, who was
      killed at Waterloo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said the tenant, &ldquo;you are quite wrong. I assure you that this is
      Esther. Your Lotitia is the girl in Oriental costume in the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Higgins, how could I possibly be mistaken over such a
      matter?&rdquo; said Miss Richards. &ldquo;My dear mother told me how Letty Brewster
      came here one day when she was eighty-two years of age, and how pathetic
      it was to see her stand before her own picture done when a girl; but my
      mother said that really some of the charm of the picture&mdash;she had
      lovely eyes, as you can see&mdash;was apparent on the face of the dear old
      lady of eighty-two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that you are mixing this picture with another,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Higgins quite good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Miss Richards gave a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better pass this picture and look at one which could not possibly
      be mixed up with another,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope you will agree with me in
      believing that this is Hoppner's Lady Charlotte Richards, Mrs. Higgins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, you are quite right about <i>that one</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs. Higgins as
      graciously as a governess commending the right answer given by an errant
      pupil. &ldquo;Oh yes, that is Lady Charlotte. I believe she became pious and
      wrote a hymn. You have heard that, I suppose, Miss Richards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe I did,&rdquo; replied Miss Richards. &ldquo;In fact, I have the tiny
      volume of hymns which she wrote. She was under the influence of Lady
      Huntingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Higgins clearly took very little interest in Lady Huntingdon, and
      she went down the gallery making mistake after mistake; but Miss Richards
      never attempted to correct her&mdash;only once she caught my eye. Mrs.
      Higgins had attributed the Master Richards of Lawrence to Sir Peter Lely!
    </p>
    <p>
      We were far away from the Castle before we had our laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't it really funny?&rdquo; said Miss Richards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you must be the most even-tempered person in the county, if
      not in all England,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendly relations existing between the two ladies were not at all
      changed by the persistent patronage of the picture gallery by the one who
      was the tenant, and Mrs. Higgins was always ready to offer a hearty
      welcome to any of Miss Richards' friends and to do the honours of the
      Castle. I did not, however, trespass upon her hospitality a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or two later I met a curious sort of gentleman who bore the same
      name as that of a family of considerable importance&mdash;county
      importance, I should say, for outside a ten-mile radius they are, as is
      usually the case, absolute nonentities. I had heard some say, however,
      that the family grounds included a rather wonderful fountain which I
      thought I should like to see. I asked the man if he was any relation to
      the family, and he replied, brightening up wonderfully, that they were his
      cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they have a nice place,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Isn't there a fountain that
      came from the Villa Borghese? I am greatly interested in that sort of
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must mean the one with the mermaids,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say that is the one,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go in for things like that you should certainly see it,&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;Let me see how I can manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But I could not think of bothering you in
      the matter. I dare say that some day I shall have a chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The family are going away for a fortnight at
      Easter, and when they are gone I could easily show you over the grounds.
      I'll just make sure of the day they leave, so that there may be no
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of a promise of such lavish hospitality, I resisted the
      temptation of being shown over the grounds in the way that was proposed:
      the fact being that I had no confidence in my own ability to act the part
      of the housekeeper's nephew or the second footman's uncle who are admitted
      to the great house when the family are away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust, however, that I convinced the enterprising cousin of the great
      house that I fully appreciated his spirited offer to allow me a peep at
      the Borghese fountain through a chink in the back door, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned subsequently that the great family started in a tannery in
      Mallingham a hundred and twenty years ago. It was no wonder that any one
      in my station of life could only be expected to approach their demesne by
      a back way.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE LEGENDS OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the subject of
      great houses, I may venture to say, it has always seemed to me to show a
      singular lack of imagination on the part of some one that one legend
      should be forced to do duty for so large a group, and this legend so
      devoid of any stimulating quality. It seems to me that the legends of the
      country houses of England are, like all Gaul, divided into three parts.
      All through the south one is shown the room in the mansion in which Queen
      Elizabeth slept. There is scarcely a Tudor house in which that particular
      monarch did not sleep for at least one night of her life, and so highly
      cherished is this family tradition that I have known of cases in which she
      slept in a room at least sixty years before the mansion itself was built.
      Then around London one is constantly pointed out by local antiquaries the
      house in which Nell Gwyn lived. &ldquo;Madam Ellen&rdquo; certainly seemed given to
      &ldquo;flitting.&rdquo; A dozen houses at least are associated with her name. North of
      the Tweed we are confronted with the Mary Queen of Scots and the Bonnie
      Prince Charlie legends. Any story that fails to touch upon the vague
      history of the worthies whom I have ventured to name as presiding over
      each department of tradition, seems to be regarded as uninteresting.
      Although monarchs of quite as blessed memory as Queen Elizabeth must have
      slept in many mansions in their time, yet few rooms are consecrated to the
      memory of their slumbers, and although many ladies of the Court were quite
      as deserving of having their memory enshrined or ensign-ed in the name of
      a fully licensed public-house as Evelyn's &ldquo;Impudent Comedian,&rdquo; yet none
      seem to be regarded as so good a draw as Nell Gwyn. The chairs of Mary
      Queen of Scots are as plentiful as the mementoes of the other Stuart
      worthies. I myself have seen in a mansion an Italian cabinet which I was
      assured had belonged to Queen Mary. But when I asked for evidence on this
      point I found that there was none forthcoming. I did not get so far as to
      make such an inquiry in the case of a mahogany looking-glass offered to me
      by a foolish dealer south of the Tweed, who declared that it had been in
      the possession of the same unfortunate lady. It was not to me, however,
      that another dealer tried to sell a dagger that had once been worn by the
      Young Pretender, the proof of its authenticity being displayed in the
      roughly cut initials &ldquo;Y.P.,&rdquo; evidently the work of Bonnie Prince Charlie
      himself, on the leather sheath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, I think it may be assumed that no monarch ever slept
      in a room that was not built until he had been dead for a hundred years.
      Fifty years should be accepted as the minimum for such an incident. And
      the probabilities are that no relic of even the most easy-going sovereign
      should be accepted as authentic that was not made within at least ten
      years from the date of his or her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the legends of the member of the family who was known as &ldquo;the
      wicked lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;Black Sir Ughtred,&rdquo; there is a tiresome sameness about
      them all, and most of them should be treated as overworn coins and called
      in. For instance, there is the story of the dreadfully wicked man of
      property&mdash;his portrait is usually in a panel over the fireplace in
      the hall&mdash;who provoked a neighbour of whom he was jealous to fight a
      duel with him after dinner one afternoon. They used pistols, taking aim
      across the table that bore the decanters and wineglasses, and the wicked
      gentleman shot his friend through the heart, but escaped the consequences
      of the fell deed by inducing his companions to announce to the world that
      the man had died simply of heart failure. The story is plausible enough,
      if you assume that the coroner and the sheriff and all the other
      authorities were three-bottle men, and it is easy to suppose that in the
      early eighteenth century such high officials might be so described; but
      there is no necessity to wind up the story by showing the visitor the mark
      that the bullet made in the linen-fold wainscoting of the dining-room. You
      see, that striking evidence of the scrupulous accuracy of the story makes
      it essential for you to believe that the fatal bullet passed through the
      worthy gentleman's heart and slued round his backbone before lodging in
      the woodwork behind him, and this is asking too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not suppose that there is a Parliamentary Division of any county in
      England that does not contain a mansion with a room in which this duel was
      fought. Upon one occasion I visited a lesser country house where I
      happened to know a duel had been fought in the dining-room in the
      eighteenth century. I did not venture to inquire of the owner if he had
      heard of that tragic incident: I did not believe that he had; but when I
      was examining a very spurious picture attributed to Canaletto, after
      admiring a dexterous forgery of a rocky landscape by Salvator Rosa, he
      drew my attention to a portrait of a &ldquo;black-avised&rdquo; gentleman in a wig,
      and the story of the historical duel came out at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must show you the panel in the dining-room that was splintered by the
      bullet,&rdquo; said my host; and though I did not insist, he kept his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; he continued, when I was looking at the imperfect woodwork,
      &ldquo;that the fellow was so stricken with remorse that he would never allow
      the panel to be repaired, in order that he might be constantly reminded of
      his deed; and it's a tradition in our family that it is never to be
      repaired, so there it is to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not make myself objectionable to the family by assuring them that
      they might send for the carpenter any time they pleased without offending
      the shades of their ancestors, for it so happened that that particular
      duel was fought with swords and not with pistols.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;FATE OF THE FAMILY PORTRAITS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n connection with
      family traditions and family portraits there are bound to be some grimly
      humorous episodes with the lapse of time, owing to the exactions of those
      Chancellors of the Exchequer who have held office since the creation of
      the Death Duties, as they are called. When a man with no ready money of
      his own inherits an estate that has not paid its expenses for many years,
      and a splendid mansion containing about fifty pictures, which, according
      to the most recent auction-room prices, may be worth from £100,000 to
      £150,000&mdash;people at picture sales think in pounds and bid in guineas&mdash;the
      question that at once presents itself is how to meet the demands of
      Somerset House. The fortunate heir, without a penny in his pocket, is
      called on to hand over from £10,000 to £15,000, according to his
      relationship to the late owner, and he wonders how he is to do it. In some
      cases that have come under my notice the only feasible way out of the
      difficulty has been taken, and some of the pictures have been sold in
      order to pay for the privilege of retaining the others. In the case of
      some historical mansions, however, every picture in the gallery is
      perfectly well known to the world, and the heir has a good many more
      qualms about selling any of them than Charles Surface had about disposing
      of his collection, with the exception of &ldquo;the little ill-looking fellow
      over the settee.&rdquo; He feels&mdash;if he is capable of any feeling at all&mdash;that
      he is selling his own flesh and blood, and he always wonders what people
      will say when they come to visit the historical house and find blank
      panels in which, for perhaps two or three hundred years, stately figures
      of men and graceful figures of women had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is he to do in such circumstances, while he is thinking his thoughts
      on a settee in the hall, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is pulling
      away like mad at the wrought-iron bell handle outside and telling the
      butler that his instructions are not to leave the place until his bill is
      paid?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that there is only one way by which the honour of the family can
      be preserved. There are trusty agents who can negotiate for an immediate
      and a secret sale of certain of the pictures. These are taken out of their
      frames or out of their panels, copies are made and put where the originals
      had been for years, and when the latter are passed on to New York or
      Chicago, unsuspecting lovers of Art stand beneath copies in admiration of
      the power of the Masters!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is how the honour of the great family remains untarnished, while the
      Chancellor of the Exchequer strikes a match on one of the stone columns of
      the porch, lights his cigarette, and goes jauntily down the avenue with a
      large cheque in his breast-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      All very well this for the time being; but a little comedy may possibly
      take place some years later, when once again Death Duties have to be paid,
      and probably at an increased rate per cent. No note may have been made of
      the pictures that were sold, and the copies have been subjected to the
      admiration of visitors without a misgiving. There are, I happen to know,
      copyists of Sir Joshua Reynolds and others of Thomas Gainsborough, Romney,
      Raeburn, Lawrence, and the rest, of such skill in reproducing the style of
      their particular Master that only the cleverest connoisseur could say,
      after the lapse of a year or two, which are the originals and which the
      copies. How, then, is a valuation to be made when the new owner enters
      upon his inheritance?
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy that it will be discovered Masters than were suspected of it had
      made replicas of their greatest works, and shipped off one to Chicago
      while selling the other to the great English families who gave them the
      order a hundred years or so ago.

      I.&mdash;THE STRANGERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN THE LATE MR.
      W. P. FRITH WAS AT the height of his fame, and engravings of his &ldquo;Derby
      Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Railway Station&rdquo; contested for prominence on the flowery
      flock-papered walls of many drawing-rooms with Landseers &ldquo;Monarch of the
      Glen,&rdquo; he went to pay a visit to his daughter in a southern county, and
      she has placed it on record that when she mentioned his name to the
      leaders of Society in various localities it conveyed nothing to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should it convey anything to them? He did nothing but paint all his
      life. Fame in painting, in music, in writing, means nothing&mdash;in many
      cases rather less than nothing&mdash;to the society of any English county.
      If the man had brought down a couple of hunters and gone out three times a
      week to hounds, the people in his division of the county would talk to you
      of him and look on you with astonishment if his name conveyed nothing to
      you; and the wife of a retired country doctor who takes up what is known
      as Church work&mdash;organising village teas and village concerts and
      Sunday &ldquo;Unions&rdquo;&mdash;is at once accorded a position that counts as fame
      in such communities in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if it were not for observing these features in country life nothing of
      its lighter side would be apparent. There is nothing so comical as a
      picture in which all the laws of perspective are ignored; and living in a
      country town in England is like placing oneself in the position of the man
      in Edgar Allan Poe's story who, looking out of his window, saw an immense
      and hideous monster&mdash;a thing with splay feet and a huge proboscis&mdash;stalking
      with mighty steps across a distant lawn, and was greatly perturbed until
      he discovered that the creature was only an ordinary sort of spider
      walking across one of the strands of its web, which was drawn across the
      window pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day one may have experience of people living in the midst of such
      distorted perspective&mdash;fancying that the commonplace insects that
      move before them are creatures of enormous proportions and importance, and
      quite as frequently assuming that because an object appears small to them,
      being far away from them, it is quite insignificant. If one cannot find
      humour in observing the attitude of people who ignore the conditions of
      perspective in this way, one must be stolid indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical inhabitant complained to me very bitterly some time ago of
      having just discharged a very thankless duty in respect of a stranger who,
      at the instigation of his brother&mdash;a London barrister of some repute&mdash;had
      called upon him in motoring through the county. He admitted that the
      stranger was a nice enough sort of man, but wholly devoid of appreciation
      of the relative importance of the persons whose houses were pointed out to
      him from the summit of the old castle which the stranger had been anxious
      to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I showed him Lord Riverland's place&mdash;as much of it as we could see
      through the trees&mdash;but all he said was, 'Who is Lord Riverland?'&rdquo;
       continued the man, pouring his complaint into my ear. &ldquo;And then I told him
      that just beyond Eglam Church was the Shillingdales' place. 'Funny name,
      Shillingdale!' was all that he remarked; but when we were leaving the
      castle he saw the gable of Maxfield's house sticking out, and he took a
      fancy to that tumbledown place and asked who lived there. I told him.
      'Maxfield,' he said. 'Not Laurence Maxfield, I suppose?' I said that I
      believed his name was Laurence. 'What! Laurence Max-field, the painter?'
      Yes, I said, I heard he was something in that line. Well, you should have
      seen his face at that. 'How can I ever thank you sufficiently for pointing
      out that house to me?' he cried. And when we got down to the road he kept
      hovering about that place, and once he said, 'What kind fate led me here
      to-day? And yet I might have gone away without so much as glancing at the
      house of Laurence Max-field!' Now, is it any wonder that I almost lost my
      temper? I had pointed out to the fellow Riverland Park and Shillingdale
      Hall, and yet I don't believe he ever heard of Lord Riverland, or knew
      that Captain Shillingdale had been made a D.L. for the county! But he
      almost became maudlin over the two old cottages that Maxfield knocked into
      one! A painter! The idea of making a fuss over a painter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that the man was a total stranger to our neighbourhood,&rdquo; said
      I. &ldquo;You must make allowances: he knew no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said he supposed the fellow really did know no better; and I am
      convinced that in his own way he abused his visitor to his wife for the
      man's deplorable lack of all sense of proportion, to ignore the privilege
      of having a distant view of the mansion of a deputy-lieutenant of an
      English county and feasting his eyes on the cottage of a painter!

      II.&mdash;THE INSECT AND THE MAMMOTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> more amusing
      example still of the insect being taken for the mammoth was given to me by
      the person whose mammoth-like proportions (intellectually) were neglected
      because all eyes were directed upon the passage of an insignificant local
      insect across the line of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a literary man whose name is known and respected in every part of
      the world&mdash;not merely in that narrow republic known as the world of
      letters. He was staying for a week at the house of a friend, when a lady,
      who was getting up a charity concert at Ringdon, calling at the house one
      day, and being told in a whisper by one of the daughters of the family
      when walking through the garden that they had a celebrity with them,
      entreated him to &ldquo;do&rdquo; something for the entertainment of her audience: she
      didn't mind what it might be that he would do, if he only agreed to do
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that the lady had a more potent qualification than
      persistence in making an appeal to a man&mdash;she was extremely
      good-looking&mdash;and the man could not resist her importunity. He
      pro-mised to tell some short stories at the concert, and, in accordance
      with the terms of his promise, he turned up in the schoolhouse where the
      concert was to take place, supported by his host and two of the family.
      But the charming lady had not mentioned the fact that the entertainment
      was to supplement a parochial tea, and when they arrived this part of the
      programme was scarcely over. There were no printed programmes; only the
      clergyman who presided had before him a list of the performers and the
      nature of their performances, and he at once called upon a young woman who
      played very prettily on the piano. A young man, who professionally was the
      assistant to the Ringdon baker, was then called upon to sing the &ldquo;Death of
      Nelson,&rdquo; which he did without faltering. When the applause had died away
      the clergyman rose from his chair and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends, we have with us this evening a gentleman who has very
      kindly consented to contribute to our entertainment. He is a gentleman
      with whose name you will all be familiar. Were he not present I should
      like to refer more particularly to his honourable career; for in his
      presence I feel that it would not be good taste to do so, and, besides, he
      is so modest that I know he would be set blushing even though I were only
      to say one-half of all that was his due. My dear friends, I call upon you
      to give a hearty welcome to Mr. Reuben Robinson, who has come all the way
      from Netherham to give you his entertainment familiar to you all, I am
      sure, under the title of 'Charlie and Charlotte.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amateur ventriloquist went on the platform with his horrid puppets,
      and the young people cheered him for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening the clergyman, without any preliminary discourse,
      called upon the literary celebrity to tell his stories. Now throughout the
      world this writer is known as Alec Bidford, and now for the first time in
      his life he heard himself alluded to as Alexander Bedford; and it became
      clear to him that the good clergyman had never heard his name before!
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the victim of the beautiful lady's importunity has a keen sense of
      humour, as any one who goes farther than the parson did, and reads one of
      his books, will not need to be told, and I have never heard him more
      humorous than when he refers to his selfconsciousness while the clergyman
      was dealing with the fame achieved by&mdash;Mr. Reuben Robinson, the
      amateur ventriloquist, who had come all the way miles from the village of
      Netherham, where he sold bacon in the daytime. I do not know what Alec
      Bid-ford's opinion is, but I do know that there are some people who
      believe that this sort of discipline is good for one, whether one may be a
      literary celebrity or some lesser personage. An appearance in a Court of
      Law usually serves the same purpose; but it must be more than irritating
      to a man whose name is known to and honoured by every member of his own
      profession to be treated in the court with no more consideration than is
      extended to the merest nonentity. The judge professes never to have heard
      his name mentioned before, and, if he has been a witness, refers to his
      evidence without thinking it necessary to give him the ordinary prefix of
      &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; I have seen six of the most distinguished literary men in England&mdash;popular
      men, too, as well as geniuses&mdash;give evidence in a Court of Law, and
      yet the calling out of name after name did not cause even one of the
      solicitors' clerks to raise his head from the paper which he was reading,
      and the jurymen chatted together without being in the smallest degree
      impressed by the prospect of hearing the great one's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also is discipline, I suppose. At any rate, it suggests that a
      provincial town is not the only place where a sense of proportion is
      lacking.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;IN THE HIGH STREET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F OUR THURSWELL IS
      A TYPICAL English village, assuredly Mallingham is a typical country town,
      only inclining to the picturesque side rather than the sordid. Like most
      picturesque towns, it is more highly appreciated by strangers than by its
      own inhabitants. Its one long street crawls along a ridge of the Downs,
      and from the lower level of the road that skirts this ridge and meanders
      among fat farms and luscious meadows, with an old Norman church here and
      there embowered in immemorial elms and granges mentioned in <i>Domesday
      Book</i>, steep lanes of old houses climb to the business street. It is
      really impossible to reach the town without a climb of some sort; and this
      fact, which made the site an ideal one, from the standpoint of the
      mediaeval founders of its walls and gates, remnants of which may yet be
      discovered by any one searching for them in a true archaeological spirit,
      causes a good deal of grumbling among the residents on both levels, who
      have to face many climbs in the course of an ordinary day's work. But
      motoring strangers, who pass through the town by the hundred every day,
      travelling between the two fashionable coast resorts, glance down the
      narrow lanes and say, &ldquo;How simply lovely!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Doesn't it remind you of
      Nuremberg?&rdquo; Perhaps it does remind them of Nuremberg&mdash;I have known
      people who affected to be reminded of Sorrento at Brighton&mdash;but for
      my part Mallingham only reminds me of an English country town, the
      convenient centre for a ten-mile area of villages. Enough business is done
      in its properly called High Street to allow of two banks keeping their
      doors open, and of half a dozen shopkeepers making modest fortunes in the
      course of a hundred years or so, and retiring from their half-timbered
      places of business to the avenue of red brick villas with well fires and
      radiators which an enterprising &ldquo;developer&rdquo; of one of the manors perceived
      to be a long-felt want. But the shops go on from generation to generation
      with the old names over the front, and in many cases with the family of
      the new generation living on the premises in the good old way. Only in
      this sense, however, may the tradesmen be said to be &ldquo;above their
      business&rdquo;; there is not the least disposition on the part of any of them
      to appear anything beyond what they are, for the simple reason that they
      do not think that the world holds anything better than a Mallingham
      tradesman. And, indeed, I am not sure that the world holds anything less
      ambitious. The aspirations of most of them do not go beyond the acquiring
      of a plate-glass frontage. Occasionally this dream literally crystallises,
      and when the crates are known to be actually awaiting delivery at the
      Goods Station, the &ldquo;consignee&rdquo; of the waybill is pointed out to strangers
      by the simple casement shopkeepers with bated breath and an occasional
      break in the voice. It is understood that the plate-glass front can only
      be achieved by a limited number of traders, and for years it was accounted
      a gross piece of presumption for any one whose lineage as a shopkeeper
      could not be traced through at least three generations of bill-heads to
      make a move in the direction of a &ldquo;front&rdquo;; but just before last Christmas
      a bolt from the blue fell upon the astonished town, for the two demure old
      ladies who kept a small millinery shop (with gloves and table linen at the
      farther end) put up bills on their small latticed window announcing a
      cheap sale in consequence of &ldquo;impending alterations.&rdquo; Now that particular
      shop front had remained unchanged for certainly a hundred and fifty years&mdash;perhaps
      two hundred and fifty years&mdash;and the two old maiden ladies who had
      looked after it for close upon half a century seemed the most conservative
      of persons, so it was taken for granted that the alterations which were
      &ldquo;impending&rdquo; had reference only to the affixing of a new sun-blind in good
      time for the summer, or perhaps an outside lamp to make the winter nights
      more cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a considerable amount of discussion on the subject an informal
      deputation waited upon the ladies to obtain information on a matter which,
      it was understood, affected the well-being of the whole community, and
      which was approaching a stage when a specific pronouncement one way or
      another was absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that the truth was revealed. The maiden ladies had, they
      confessed, been surreptitiously discussing the putting in of a plate-glass
      front, and they had come to the conclusion that as they were both old and
      life at best was uncertain, they should not any longer procrastinate the
      carrying out of a scheme which the growth of the town and its increasing
      importance fully warranted, they thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took just four days to fix the new front in its place; but it was the
      topic of the town for months, and even now you will see an occasional
      group of town people discussing the innovation and wondering what things
      are coming to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dimensions of the topic were, as I ascertained for my own
      satisfaction, nine feet broad by seven feet high. This was the <i>premier
      pas</i>. It led to the extravagance of a sunk letter sign, picked out in
      gold, an outside lamp, and a spring sun-blind, all of the most
      conventional pattern, and all to my mind in the condition of the &ldquo;party in
      a parlour&rdquo; in the Wordsworth parody. In short, a charming old house with
      many features of interest was transformed into a foolish hybrid thing&mdash;a
      single sheet of plate-glass on the ground floor, beneath two pairs of
      small cottage casements with delightful stone eaves. So prosperity turns
      out the picturesque or, at least, relegates it to the basement, and so a
      street with all the charm of past centuries clinging to it is fast
      becoming commonplace, and strangers driving through it laugh at the feeble
      attempts to give the commercial air of Harrods to a row of cottages&mdash;about
      as sensible a proceeding as it would be to attempt to assimilate the
      façade of Hampton Court with that of Hampton's in Pall Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily there are still some sixteenth-century eaves left and also some
      eighteenth-century bow windows&mdash;the gentle curved bow of the
      eighteenth century, not the detestable obtuse-angle things of the
      mid-nineteenth&mdash;and happily the spirit of commercial enterprise does
      not pervade the entire community. Several of the houses that have been
      turned into shops contain admirable chimneypieces and panelled rooms, with
      an occasional fire-back and basket grate. It seems, too, that there must
      have lived in the place a century or so ago a master workman with a great
      fancy for decorating chimneypieces after the style of Adam; for in many of
      the rooms of sixteenth-century houses may be found quite good examples of
      the early style of Robert Adam. In one house there is a fine parlour
      decorated throughout in this way.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;PRECIOUS PANELLING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome time ago a
      mason, while doing some repairs in a room in a very old timbered house,
      disclosed some oak panelling which probably belonged to the sixteenth
      century. The news of the discovery went abroad, and a collector of
      &ldquo;antiques&rdquo; in the neighbourhood bought the woodwork for a hundred pounds&mdash;far
      more than it was worth, of course, but that is nothing; the effect of the
      find and of the sale was disastrous to the occupants of other old houses,
      for they forthwith summoned masons and carpenters and began pulling down
      their walls, feeling sure that a hundred pounds' worth of panelling was
      within their reach. They were all disappointed; for several years had
      passed before the landlord of the chief hotel&mdash;it had once been the
      county town house of a great local family&mdash;found behind the battens
      which served as the stretchers of the canvas that bore some very common
      paper in his coffee-room, a long range of oak wainscoting covered with
      paint. The usual local antiquary made his appearance, and through dilating
      upon its beauty and abusing the vandalism that had spread those coats of
      paint upon the oak, induced the landlord to give the order to have the
      panels &ldquo;stripped&rdquo; and made good. He little knew what he had let himself in
      for! The carpenters and the painters attacked the room with spirit (of
      turpentine), and for weeks it remained in their hands; for it was found
      that at least twenty coats of paint were upon the woodwork, and that a
      great portion of it was only held together by the paint, so that with the
      removal of this binding medium the panels became splinters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of a profitless six weeks the good landlord was wishing
      with all his heart that that relic of a bygone period had been allowed to
      rest comfortably buried beneath the papered canvas that had entombed it
      all. The bill that he had to pay for the restoration was for such a sum as
      would have been sufficient to buy the same quantity of absolutely new
      panelling, he explained to some people to whom he went for sympathy! He
      laid great stress upon the fact that he could actually have got new
      panelling for the price of repairing the old!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0103.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      And this was the spirit in which a far-seeing but non-antiquarian lady,
      who lived in another ancient house in the same street, received the
      liberal offer of a gentleman from the United States who had taken a fancy
      to her oak staircase. It was a commonplace type and might be found by the
      dozen in any old town; but he told her that he would pay her a hundred
      pounds for it, and she jumped at his offer. The staircase was carted away
      and a new one of serviceable deal, absolutely fresh from the carpenter's
      shop, was put in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her example induced a relation of hers&mdash;also a maiden approaching the
      venerable stage&mdash;to sell the panelling of one room, the fireplace of
      another, the Georgian pillared cupboards of a third, and actually the old
      black and white slabs of the square hall. Hearing of all this selling
      going on, an enthusiast made her an offer for the pillared porch of the
      house, and another for the leaden cistern on the roof and the copper
      rain-water head. Last of all, a man who was building a house in imitation
      of the old in the neighbourhood set covetous eyes upon her twisted
      chimney-pots and some peculiar coping tiles on the roof. She accepted
      every offer&mdash;with modifications; but when she had fulfilled her part
      of the business she found herself a solitary figure amid the ruin of a
      nice house, but with a nice little sum in her pocket. It was at this
      juncture that an enterprising tradesman from Brindlington, who was on the
      look out for &ldquo;branches,&rdquo; came upon the half-dismantled house. Thinking
      that it was about to be pulled down, he made inquiries about it, and these
      he considered so satisfactory that he bought, at a good price, all that
      the previous speculators had left of it, completed their work of
      demolition, and within six months had erected upon the site some
      &ldquo;desirable business premises&rdquo; in the cheapest red brick, with an
      inconceivable broad expanse of plate-glass which he called somebody's
      &ldquo;Co-operative Stores.&rdquo; He had co-operated with so many people in carrying
      out the work of destruction in regard to the old premises, it seemed only
      fit that the same principle should be maintained in their reconstruction.
      The place is only a branch establishment, but it is said to be flourishing
      as well as the parent tree.

      III.&mdash;THE AMENITIES OF THE HIGH STREET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>very here and
      there between the shops in the High Street is a house that has survived
      the request&mdash;it never amounts to a demand in Mallingham&mdash;for
      &ldquo;business premises.&rdquo; Quite unpretentious is the appearance of all these
      houses, but the front door opens upon a hall that is a hall, and not a
      mere passage to a narrow staircase. Admirably proportioned rooms are to be
      found on every floor, and usually a door at the farther end of the hall
      admits one to a garden, and not a mere patch of green. Here are gardens
      that have been cultivated for hundreds of years and so artfully designed
      that each of them has the appearance of a park, with lawns, and terraces,
      and pergolas. Here, not thirty feet back from the street, are acres of
      orchard, with mulberry trees of the original stock introduced by James I.
      to make possible his scheme of English silk weaving. The arbutus has also
      a home in several of these surprising pleasure grounds, with several other
      rare but fully acclimatised flowering shrubs. Shady walks among giant
      lilacs and laburnums lead to banks of roses and beds of lilies, and hardy
      borders of brilliant colour such as a stranger could never fancy might be
      found in so unpromising a region.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lucky residents in these wonderful houses are usually extremely
      exclusive&mdash;if they were not so, goodness only knows what might
      happen. When a lady of good family finds herself living next door to a
      grocer and an ironmonger, she is bound to take steps to prevent the
      possibility of any one fancying that she belongs to that <i>galère</i>,
      and the steps that some of them take with this fact in their mind are
      sometimes very diverting. They usually assume the form of ignoring the
      existence, not so much of the grocer and the ironmonger as of the other
      ladies similarly situated. If you call upon Miss Wheatly at No. 10 High
      Street and, after praising up her garden, refer to the garden of Miss
      Keightley at No. 20, Miss Wheatley will express great interest, saying she
      has often heard that Miss Keightley's garden is quite charming, but she
      has never seen it for herself. Miss Keightley on her side may go even
      further, and not merely pretend that she has never heard of Miss
      Wheatley's garden, but also that she had no idea that any one named
      Wheatley lived in the town. This is at first, but she occasionally betrays
      a scrupulous anxiety to be accurate by asking, &ldquo;What did you say the name
      was? Wheatley? Oh yes, to be sure I remember hearing the other day that a
      Miss Wheatley lived at No. 10. And you say she has a nice garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And these good ladies may have been living within a few doors of one
      another for forty odd years, and the father of the one may have been in
      the butter trade, while the father of the other was in eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social distinctions in a country town such as Mallingham are sometimes
      very pathetic. It might be thought that the people would find a bond of
      union in that illiteracy which they enjoy in common, or in that profound
      ignorance of everything connected, however distantly, with art or science
      in which they live from one end of the year to the other; but one does not
      find it so. Mallingham is perhaps the most ill-informed town in England on
      all matters pertaining to culture, whether literary or artistic. A
      stranger who was unacquainted with this fact thought he was scoring a
      point in a speech which he had been called on to make in the absence of
      the Member for the Division at the annual banquet of the Barham Trust&mdash;the
      most important incident of the winter in Mallingham&mdash;when he remarked
      that he felt that the town must be the centre of the greatest literary
      activity; for, motoring through the High Street, he found on one of the
      shop signs the name Swift, on another the name Smollett, a little farther
      on he came upon an Addison (great applause), and finally he found himself
      close to the house of Hume. Surely, he said, these names spoke for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had need to, for none of the élite of Mailingham could speak for any
      of them, except Addison, for Mr. Addison was a pork butcher, who the day
      before had been elected a member of the Corporation, after a hard struggle
      with a saddler. It so happened that the bearers of all the other literary
      names were not applaudable people&mdash;two of them were definitely
      unpopular&mdash;but the name of Mr. Addison was received with cheers, not
      by reason of his connection with <i>The Spectator</i>, but simply because
      of his recent achievement, and no one at the banquet had the least idea
      what the orator was referring to in bringing forward that string of names.
      &ldquo;He might surely have mentioned Mr. Fawley, who was twice Mayor, or George
      Hanson, who has just bought the saw mills,&rdquo; a prominent burgess remarked
      to me when I was in his shop the next day. &ldquo;But what has Peter Swift done,
      or Tom Smollett, or even Walter Hume? Decent enough men, I don't deny, but
      out of place when named in prominence at the Barham Banquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never met anyone in the town who had heard these names in any other
      connection than that of Mailingham shopkeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time later a new curate at St Bartholomew's, when proposing a vote of
      thanks to the chairman of one of his social meetings (with a magic lantern
      and an amateur ventriloquist), became erudite and droll by referring to
      &ldquo;what Dr. Johnson said about music.&rdquo; The next day one of the churchwardens&mdash;a
      land agent&mdash;asked him how on earth he could attribute such a
      sentiment to Dr. Johnson. &ldquo;I knew Dr. Johnson as well as most people, and
      there never was a man in the town who enjoyed a song better or knew better
      what a good song was,&rdquo; he said; and when the perplexed curate recovered
      himself sufficiently to be able to explain that there was another Dr.
      Johnson who said things besides the person of the same name who had once
      enjoyed quite a large and lucrative practice as a fully qualified
      veterinary surgeon at Mallingham, the churchwarden smiled and shook his
      head. &ldquo;As much as to say,&rdquo; the clergyman added in telling me the story&mdash;&ldquo;as
      much as to say that my excuse was far from plausible, but that he would
      accept it to prevent the matter going farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That narrative I found to be beautifully typical of the literary erudition
      of Mallingham.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;THE TWO ICONOCLASTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome four or five
      miles away are the imposing ruins of a great abbey of the Franciscans. It
      had once been of so great importance in the land that when the archabbey
      wrecker decreed that it should be demolished, he sent his most trustworthy
      housebreaker to carry out his orders. Now everybody of education in
      Mallingham can tell you all that is known about the venerable ruin, and it
      is the pride of the town that it should be so closely connected with the
      history of the Abbey; but I have never yet met with any layman in the
      neighbourhood who was not under the impression that the crime of its
      destruction should be added to the pretty long account of that Cromwell
      who was called Oliver, and I should not like to be the person who would
      suggest that there was another Cromwell&mdash;one who did not decapitate
      his king, but whom his king decapitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, however, it must be acknowledged that the people of
      Mallingham do not stand alone in mixing up those iconoclasts. I have found
      that in many parts of England as well as Ireland every deficiency in the
      features of a church figure or a church ornament is attributed to the
      later Cromwell. In Ireland I have had pointed out to me by clergymen of
      both churches the headless saints and the broken carvings caused by the
      fury of &ldquo;Cromwell,&rdquo; though I knew perfectly well that the work of
      sacrilege could not have been done by him, for two reasons, the first
      being that in his devastating progress through Ireland he had never
      approached the places in question, and the second being that the sacred
      buildings in which the damage was done had not been built until long after
      Cromwell had sailed for England, after being soundly-beaten at Clonmel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course in Ireland there was only one &ldquo;curse of Cromwell&rdquo;; but in
      England I soon found that there were two, and so the progress of confusion
      began, until at the present time, when you are visiting any old church and
      see in a niche an adult saint with a broken nose, or a carved rood screen
      deficient about the rood, the verger&mdash;sometimes the rector himself&mdash;is
      quite fluent in explaining that the heavy hand of Cromwell must be held
      accountable for the spoliation. If you ask which of the two, the answer
      will most certainly be, &ldquo;Why, Cromwell to be sure&mdash;Cromwell&mdash;Oliver
      Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An outsider should not interfere. The shade of Oliver would not shudder,
      even if such an expression of emotion were permitted the shadiest of
      shades, at the accusation being directed against him instead of the older
      Cromwell. He would probably say, if speech were allowed to him, &ldquo;I have
      the greatest possible satisfaction in allowing my name to be associated
      with any act of iconoclasm of the nature of those acts so conscientiously
      perpetrated by my distinguished countryman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would feel that, could he have had any hand in smashing in the roofs of
      monasteries and despoiling rich abbeys, it would be accounted to him for
      righteousness. After such splendid acts of spoliation, knocking the nose
      off a poorly carved saint could not but seem a paltry thing, quite
      unworthy of any man with a reputation for a heavy hand to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mallingham, for all its literary and historical ignorance, has its
      heart in the right place; and it is staunch to Church and State&mdash;staunch
      to the core. Every Fifth of November it has its procession emblematic of
      these principles, and it must be confessed that the symbolism of the
      movement is not exclusive. To express adequately the loyalty of
      Mallingham, it is found necessary to set forth in marching order Turks,
      male and female, Negroes, Zulus, Toreadors, Pierrots, Harlequins, the
      Archbishop of Canterbury, Pirates, Mary Queen of Scots, Firemen, Dragoons,
      William Shakespeare, a Sailor, and many other characters, all of whom, it
      must be taken for granted, typify the triumph of Loyalty. Should any
      question a-rise&mdash;for captious inquirers may always be reckoned on in
      these days of high educational achievement&mdash;as to the identity of the
      leading typical figure in this pageant and the reason of the obloquy that
      is heaped upon him, culminating in the stake, with foul-mouthed
      explosives, the answer is that he is one Guy Fox, and that he is paying
      the penalty of having failed to blow up the Houses of Parliament. After
      that explanation no one can doubt that, whoever he was, he richly deserves
      his fate&mdash;or should it be spelt <i>fête?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally co-opted with him is an unpopular person of distinction in
      the neighbourhood&mdash;a clergyman who lies under the stigma of preaching
      toleration, a police superintendent with a constitutional distaste for
      bonfires and low-flash explosives in the public streets, or perhaps a
      District Visitor suspected of &ldquo;leanings.&rdquo; But usually by midnight the
      worst is over, and good nature without intoxicants prevails throughout the
      motley crowd; the Archbishop of Canterbury lights his cigarette&mdash;one
      of the packet with the pictures&mdash;from that of the Pirate King; Mary
      Queen of Scots hurries to the house where she discharges the duties of
      parlour-maid, complaining to a sympathetic Shakespeare that she has to be
      up at six in the morning to let in the sweep, and so home to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only literary fact which is impressed upon all the townspeople is that
      by some way never made quite clear, the singeing effigy, whose obsequies
      have been so imposing, was responsible for a <i>Book of Martyrs.</i> The
      general idea is that he was responsible for the martyrs themselves, and
      that Foxes <i>Book of Martyrs</i> is a sort of catalogue with descriptive
      text of his victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as has been stated, the two Cromwells have but a single identity in
      the minds of Mallingham.

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;THE SOCIAL &ldquo;SETS&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f course there is
      in Mallingham, as in every other country town, a first set and a second
      set&mdash;perhaps even a third, but that must be very close indeed to the
      unclassed tradesmen set, which is no set at all. And here it may be
      mentioned that the tradesmen's families are, as a rule, very much more
      refined and almost invariably better educated than the families of the
      first or second sets. Some years ago there was an amateur performance of
      one of Mr. Sutro's delightful plays given in aid of some deserving
      charity. Charity performances cover, as does Charity itself, a multitude
      of sins, but the leading lady did not need to make any appeal for
      leniency, so ably did she represent the part of the refined woman who was
      not quite sure whether she loved her husband or not. She was the daughter
      of a professional man, but had never succeeded in getting into the first
      set; for it must be remembered that there is no graduating from one set to
      another: one is either accepted or rejected at once. A couple of years
      later, however, the play was repeated, only this time it was under the
      highest patronage, so the management resolved to get the real thing. They
      managed to secure the services of a lady of title for the chief part, and
      the result was appalling. The refinement had vanished from the part, so
      had the correct pronunciation of the English language, so had the good
      taste in the toilettes worn, so had every vestige of intelligence. In
      place of these we were shown a pert young person with a voice like that of
      a barmaid in a country inn and a taste in dress to correspond. In the
      matter of memory for the words of the dialogue also the advantage was
      certainly on the side of the humbler representative of the part. In one of
      Mr. Henry James' most delightful short stories the catastrophe of &ldquo;The
      Real Thing&rdquo; is depicted. It was not more pronounced than that of the
      second representation of the comedy.

    <p>
      It is really very difficult to understand what are the qualifications for
      the best set in Mallingham; but somehow people usually find themselves in
      the set that suits them, and very seldom do the rulers of the social
      grades in Mallingham make a mistake. They have now and again sailed very
      close to the wind, however; for that was a nasty rub they got when they
      hastened to call upon a stranger, with the title of Baroness, who had
      taken a house in the new part of the town and kept a man-servant. As the
      story was told me, the ladies jammed one another in the doorway in their
      anxiety to be the first caller upon the Baroness, or Madame la Baronne, as
      the wife of a retired Indian civil servant called her, having studied the
      idioms of the <i>Comédie française</i>. Madame la Baronne was indeed a
      lady of great personal charm, and she was invited everywhere&mdash;even to
      the villa of the wife of the leading brewer, which represented a sort of
      Distinguished Strangers' Gallery in Mallingham. The competition among the
      most select for the presence of Madame at their houses was strenuous; and
      as she was in such demand it really should not have been regarded as so
      surprising that a London magistrate should send her a peremptory
      invitation by the hand of two detectives to come to the court over which
      he presided. His messengers would take no denial, he wanted her so badly,
      so she had perforce to throw over her local engagements and grant the
      magistrate the favour which he requested of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her portrait was in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> the next day, in connection
      with a startling series of headlines, beginning, &ldquo;The Bogus Baroness Again&mdash;Arrest
      at Mallingham.&rdquo; She was one of the most notorious swindlers that France
      ever returned to her native shore, after a series of exploits in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies of Mallingham ran up against one another in the porch of her
      villa in their haste to get back the cards they had left upon her.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;THE CASE OF MR. STANWELL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat was what might
      be termed &ldquo;a close call&rdquo; upon the dignity and discrimination of the
      leaders of Society in Mallingham, and this was possibly why they held back
      when a man and his wife bearing the name Stanwell took a house in the
      town. The lady seemed quite nice and the man was passable, and before they
      had &ldquo;settled down&rdquo; it was noised abroad that they had a car: it need
      scarcely be said that to &ldquo;have a car&rdquo; is in country districts nowadays as
      sure a sign of respectability as &ldquo;driving a gig&rdquo; was in the 'thirties.
      There seemed to be no reason why these people should not be called upon by
      the leaders of Mallingham Society; but the leaders were getting more
      cautious than ever since the Baroness' scandal, and they hung back, none
      of them wishing to take a step which it would be impossible to recall, and
      every day the question of to call or not to call was informally discussed.
      It was just at this critical moment, when the fate of the Stanwells was
      trembling in the balance, so to speak, that one of the leaders was visited
      by a London friend, and on the name Stanwell being mentioned, this person
      asked, &ldquo;Is that Herbert Stanwell, the author? It must be. I heard that he
      was leaving London and going to live in the country. They are all going.
      Soon we shall not have an author left in London; though I remember the
      time when they all lived there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Mr. Stanwell has a car, I hear,&rdquo; was the &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; suggestion made
      by the Mallingham lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So has Herbert Stanwell&mdash;he has been photographed in it dozens of
      times. Dear me! To think of Herbert Stanwell coming down here!&rdquo; was the
      exclamation of the visitor; and the moment that she had gone back to
      London her hostess rushed round to her partners in the government of
      social Mallingham, and breathlessly announced that she had discovered that
      Mr. Stanwell was an author and that Mrs. Stanwell was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; was the whispered exclamation from the syndicate. &ldquo;Who
      would have believed it? And we were actually thinking of calling upon
      them! And they look quite respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have a car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Car, or no car, what I tell you is the truth. Is he not 'H. Stanwell?'
      and the authors name is Herbert. There's no doubt about it. And my friend,
      who knows everybody in London, said that Herbert Stanwell was about to
      live in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assumed the pose of a Princess Hohenstïel Schwangau, saviour of
      Society, and she and her friends talked of how providential were certain
      incidents, let scoffers say what they might; for if she had not by the
      merest accident&mdash;ah, a providential accident!&mdash;mentioned the
      name of the Stanwells, no one would have known anything about them, and
      they might have been visited quite in good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted, feeling that Providence was, very properly, mindful of the
      best interests of Mallingham; and so it was decreed that the newcomers&mdash;that
      pair who had made the attempt to get within the citadel of Mallingham's
      exclusiveness, not storming it boldly, but by the insidious device of
      concealing the fact that at least one of them was the author of over
      twenty novels&mdash;were not to be called on, although they had a car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a month had passed, however, <i>The Happy Home</i>, a magazine
      widely circulated at Mallingham on account of its admirable paper
      patterns, contained an interview with Herbert Wilfred Stanwell, giving an
      excellent protrait of the distinguished author sitting (as usual) in his
      motor-car, with his favourite Chow, <i>Ming</i>, beside him; and the
      &ldquo;letterpress&rdquo; stated that he was unmarried, and that he had just taken a
      charming cottage at Henley (illustrated), on the lawn of which
      (illustrated), it might be taken for granted, all that was illustrious in
      Literature, Art, and the Drama would be found at week-ends during the
      summer, Mr. Stanwell's hospitality being proverbial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day cards were left upon Mr. H. Stanwell and his wife, and it was
      universally admitted that they formed quite a congenial addition to
      Mailing-ham Society. He was a pleasant man and she was a charming woman.
      They came to Mallingham with a clean bill of health. Neither of them had
      done anything in the world, and the only time their names had appeared in
      the newspapers was when they had been married. They were nonentities to
      their finger-tips, and they soon took a high place among the nonentities
      of Mallingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanwell sorrowfully admits that more than once he has been asked in
      hotels in France and Italy if he was any relation to Herbert Stanwell, the
      great author. It is very annoying, he says, but he hopes to live it down.
      If he continues to live at Mallingham, he may be assured that his hopes
      run every chance of being realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is greatly to be feared that the leading &ldquo;note&rdquo; of Mallingham is not
      literature. It is Thurswell that occasionally lays claim to be a great
      reading centre. It was in the most friendly spirit of honest patronage
      that a lady addressed a letter to George Eliot, commending some of the
      characters in <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, but regretting that the story
      had not a happy ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it never reached him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had sent it under cover to the
      publishers, but they returned it to me, with a scrawl across it, evidently
      done by a clerk, saying, '<i>Present address of</i> George Eliot not
      known, so, after all my trouble, it never reached him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having mentioned <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, I feel bound to say that
      neither in Thurswell nor Mallingham did the sporting innkeeper live who,
      on seeing a cheap edition of the book advertised, at once sent for it and
      read the greater part of it before he found out that he had been too hasty
      in taking for granted that it was written round a prizefight. A &ldquo;mill&rdquo;
       meant to him primarily such an incident, and his excursions into the magic
      realms of literature had practically been confined to the spirited
      accounts given incertain weekly papers of such encounters. A mill as an
      industrial building conveyed quite a secondary idea to him. He admitted to
      a friend of mine who found the book in the bar parlour, and wondered how
      it got he had been &ldquo;had&rdquo; over it, and his faith in the accuracy of
      literary advertisements got a severe jar. How was he to tell, he asked,
      that the chap meant another sort of mill?
    </p>

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;THE MAYOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE OF THE
      PECULIARITIES OF MALLINGHAM is the Mayor, for Mallingham has a Mayor all
      to itself, except when, by virtue of his office, he spends a happy day on
      various County Benches, joining with the representatives of local county
      families in the administration of Petty Sessions justice&mdash;Petty
      Sessions justice is founded on &ldquo;good Crowner's Quest law&rdquo;&mdash;otherwise
      he is usually a very worthy man, and lays no specious claim to popularity.
      He is never ostentatious or self-assertive, and in spite of the position
      which he occupies, he is in private life as sound an exponent of domestic
      virtue as if he were an ordinary simple citizen. The eminence to which he
      has risen never makes him lose his head or forget that kind hearts are
      more than coronets, and only very little inferior to a Mayoral Chain of
      office. It was the proud but very proper boast of a Mayor of Mallingham
      that although he had been proprietor of a provision business in the very
      centre of the town for over forty years, and had worn the chain for two
      consecutive terms, he was still just as approachable as any man in the
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it was said in the Napoleonic days that every French soldier
      carried the <i>bâton</i> of a Field-Marshal in his knapsack, and as it is
      said in these days in the States that any citizen may one day become
      President&mdash;the contingency may account for the gloomy view so many
      American citizens take of life&mdash;so it is understood that any burgess
      of Mallingham may one day become Mayor. There is, however, no competition
      for the office, so unambitious are the majority of the burgesses; and now
      and again the Council find themselves face to face with the problem of how
      to induce any one to accept the chain of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering all that its acceptance entails upon the wearer, it can easily
      be understood that there should be some reluctance to have anything to do
      with it within the ranks of the eligible. If it were an understood thing
      that the burgesses of the town must buy their bacon and butter from the
      Mayor during his term of office, the problem of the Mayoralty might become
      less acute&mdash;assuming that a bacon and butter candidate were
      available; but no suggestion of this sort has ever been made so far as I
      can gather, and thus the difficulty is increasing year by year with the
      using up of all the available material for Mayors in the rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that a great deal too much is expected from the Mayor. There
      is an inaugural banquet every year at which some two hundred burgesses,
      and several of the local gentry, and Members of Parliament, with a bishop,
      a rural dean, and an occasional chaplain to the forces, sit down on the
      invitation of the incoming Mayor.&mdash;He is expected to pay for
      everything, and as the feast is founded on the noblest traditions of civic
      catering, his bill cannot but be a heavy one. In no way is the menu
      inferior in interest to that to be found on the table of the Mansion House
      in the City of London. As a matter of fact, I believe that the turtle soup
      served at the Mallingham banquet is a trifle richer than that in the
      Mansion House, and the champagne is possibly a little sweeter. But the
      status of the large proportion of the guests at the one is widely
      different from that of the majority at the other. In Mallingham the
      tradesmen&mdash;gas-fitters, grocers, tobacconists, hair-cutters,
      newsagents, and the like&mdash;who are probably accustomed to a midday
      dinner of a cut from the joint, two vegetables, cheese, and a glass of
      ale, and want nothing better, work their way through a long and elaborate
      succession of dishes, between the <i>hors d'ouvres assortis</i> and the
      home-grown pineapple, drinking glass after glass of Ayala, <i>cuvée
      reservée</i>. Of course they may appreciate some of the simpler delicacies&mdash;<i>vol-au-vent</i>
      or the <i>faysans rotis</i>&mdash;but the most of the dishes are mysteries
      to them and, though very expensive, altogether obnoxious to the uneducated
      palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, the banquet is artfully meant: it is supposed to be by way of
      so incapacitating the diners that they are forced to listen to the
      speeches that follow. Only by the adoption of such stringent measures
      would it be possible to get a hearing for those speeches, made in all
      solemnity by the gentlemen at the High Table. A loyal Mayor has been known
      to spend twenty minutes over the Royal Family, after the King and Queen
      had been honoured&mdash;he took a quarter of over Their Majesties; but
      then the evening was comparatively young, and &ldquo;The Bishops and Clergy of
      the Established Church,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Clergy of other Denominations,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Member
      of Parliament for the Division,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Worshipful the Mayor,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      Corporation of Mallingham,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Official Staff,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Town and Trade of
      Mallingham&rdquo;&mdash;all these had to be proposed and replied to in due
      course, and the general opinion was that in making up the accounts, with
      the banquet on the credit side and the speeches on the debit, a large
      balance remained against the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the inaugural banquet is merely the first of the series of
      entertainments which are supposed to come from the same source. Two or
      three balls, as many garden parties, and at least four large receptions,
      with refreshments, are looked for by the townspeople of all grades, for
      even the most exclusive of the leaders of the best set do not object to be
      entertained at the expense of the Mayor. They consider it their duty to
      attend the dances as well as the receptions; but there the transaction
      ends so far as they are concerned. They feel that they are honouring him
      by accepting his hospitality, and they do not consider that they are under
      the obligation to recognise him or his family if they meet in the public
      street, nor do they think it necessary to invite him or any member of his
      family to their houses. They really believe in their hearts that they lay
      the Mayor under an obligation to themselves by attending his receptions
      and his dances.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE FIRST FAMILIES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat is the
      attitude of these good people whose names are quite unknown outside
      Mallingham. They are amusing through the entire lack on their part of a
      sense of comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inclined to think, however, that the attitude of a son of one of
      these First Families, in respect of an incident that came under my notice,
      might be more definitely described. He had been invited by a man who was
      in a far better social position than himself to have a day with the
      partridges in a shooting which he leased; the youth accepted, and on the
      morning of the day named appeared in a dog-cart, bringing with him a
      friend with another gun. They passed the man who had given the invitation,
      and who was walking to the first field and had still a mile or so to go
      before reaching it; but though there was a vacant seat in the dog-cart he
      was not asked to take it. They drove gaily on, and did not even wait for
      him to come up with his dogs to begin operations. One of them was walking
      up one side of the field and the other was walking up the parallel side.
      The lessee of the shooting, on arriving, found himself taking rather a
      back place, the fact being that he had no acquaintance with his friend's
      friend, and his friend apparently not thinking it necessary to introduce
      him. The shoot went on, however, and, save for a little grumbling at the
      working of the dogs, it was successful enough. On getting round to the
      dog-cart, after walking through the last field, the visitors collected the
      birds that they had shot and tucked them under the back seat, and mounting
      to the front called out a cheery &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to the man who had entertained
      them. They were about to drive off, but the breaking strain of the other's
      politeness had been passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't mind a lift from you,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; explained the one with the reins; &ldquo;but you see how rough the lane
      is, and really the machine is too heavy as it is. Ta-ta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On minute,&rdquo; said the pedestrian. &ldquo;If it's too heavy I'll jolly soon
      remedy that,&rdquo; and he took a step to the dog-cart and pulled out the birds.
      &ldquo;Pity you didn't think of that before. Now it's lighter. Off you go, and
      the next time you are offered a day's shooting you just inquire, from some
      one who knows, how you should behave. You will in that way be prevented
      from appearing a complete bounder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time afterwards there was a sort of coldness between that man and
      the First Family, whose representative had been prevented by him from
      adding three brace of partridges to their menu for the next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a plentiful lack of good manners the representatives of the &ldquo;best set&rdquo;
       in Mallingham could scarcely be surpassed in any community. The youth
      probably was quite sincere in his belief that he was conferring a
      conspicuous favour upon the man who had invited him to an afternoon among
      the partridges. How could it be expected that he should think differently
      when he had seen his mother and sisters feasting at the Mayoral ball one
      night, and cutting the Mayor the next day when they met him in the street?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a Mayoress of Mallingham, but of a much more important
      municipality&mdash;one, in fact, of so great importance as to have a Lord
      Mayor and a Lady Mayoress&mdash;who had the privilege of entertaining a
      certain elderly offshoot of the Royal Family upon the occasion of the
      laying of the foundation-stone of a new hospital in the town. This
      particular minor Royalty is well known (in certain circles) for her ample
      appreciation of the dignity of her exalted position, and, like all such
      ladies, she is gracious in proportion to such dust of the earth as
      Mayoresses and Presidents of Colleges and Chairmen of Hospital Boards; and
      she made herself so pleasant to the Lady Mayoress who was entertaining
      her, that the latter determined to keep up the acquaintance, so she made
      it a point to pay her a visit in her private capacity. She drove up the
      stately avenue to the mansion, and inquired if Her Royal Highness were at
      home, just as if Her Royal Highness had been the wife of the vicar. She
      was admitted&mdash;as far as a certain room&mdash;and after an interval of
      long waiting there entered, not Her Royal Highness, but a stranger, a
      member of the &ldquo;Household&rdquo; of the minor Royalty, and they had a chilly chat
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the friendship so auspiciously begun at the opening of the municipal
      hospital made no advance beyond this interview, though it is understood
      that the lady of the Household was as polite as if she were Her Royal
      Highness herself.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;MISS LATIMER'S MARRIAGE LINES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is nothing
      that the best set in Mallingham so resent as pretentiousness, or the
      semblance of pretentiousness, on the part of any one who does not belong
      to the best set. A few years ago a Mrs. Latimer, who lives in a delightful
      old house close to our village of Thurswell and is a widow, married one of
      her two pretty and accomplished daughters to a young man who was beginning
      to make a name for himself at the Bar. He had been at Uppingham and
      Oxford, and was altogether the sort of person by whose side the most
      fastidious young woman would not shrink from meeting her enemy in the
      Gate. The wedding was made an event of more than usual importance, for the
      girl and her mother were greatly liked, and on the mother's side were
      connections of actual county rank. The list of names in the county
      newspaper of the wedding guests and of the numerous presents was an
      imposing one: among the former was the widow of a Baronet, a County Court
      Judge, a Major-General (retired), and a Master of Hounds; and among the
      latter, a diamond and sapphire necklace (the gift of the bridegroom), a
      cheque (from the bride's uncle), a silver-mounted dressing-bag (from the
      bride's sister), and the usual silver-backed brushes, button-hooks,
      shoe-lifters, blotters, and nondescript articles. When the late Dr.
      Schliemann exhibited the result of his excavations at the supposed site of
      Troy, there were to be seen several articles to which no use could
      possibly be assigned. No one seemed to perceive that these must have been
      wedding presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, generally allowed that the wedding had been a very pretty
      one, that the bride had looked her best, and that the bridegroom appeared
      a good fellow; and in addition to the column and a half devoted to the
      affair by a generous newspaper, there appeared the usual announcement:
      Weston&mdash;Latimer.&mdash;On the 2nd inst., at Thurswell Church, by the
      Rev. Theophilas Watson, B.A.Oxon, Vicar of Thurswell, late Incumbent of
      St. Michael and All Angels, Bardswell, and Rural Dean, assisted by the
      Rev. Anselm Sigurd Mott, M. A., late Fellow of King's College, London, and
      Senior Curate of St. James the Less, Brindlington, William Henry, eldest
      son of the late John Weston of King's Elms, Leicestershire, to Ida Evelyn,
      elder daughter of the late George Cruikshank Latimer, of Todderwell, and
      Susan Prescott Latimer, of Grange Lodge, Thurswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the advertised notice in the <i>Telegraph</i>, as well as in the
      local paper, on the day after the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days later, however, there appeared, in the corresponding
      column of the <i>Post</i>, an amended version of the same announcement&mdash;Weston&mdash;Latimer.&mdash;On
      the 2nd inst., at Thurswell Parish Church, William Henry Weston, eldest
      son of the late John Weston, Attorney's Clerk, King's Elms,
      Leicestershire, to Ida, daughter of the late George C. Latimer, Farmer,
      Todderwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of feline malevolence was easily traced to a lady with a highly
      marriageable daughter who had been posing for several years as one of the
      guardians of &ldquo;exclusiveness&rdquo; of Mallingham. An adroit lady had only to pay
      her a visit, ostensibly to call her attention to the delightful
      announcement&mdash;&ldquo;the cleverest thing that had ever been done,&rdquo; she
      called it&mdash;to invite a return of confidence, and, with sparkling
      eyes, the perpetrator accepted the credit of thinking out the scheme for
      the humiliation of her neighbour for her arrogance in making so much of
      the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the most melancholy part of the contemptible affair was that the
      greater number of the best set actually talked over it as a properly
      administered blow to the Latimers, and chuckled over it for many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very next year Mrs. Latimer's other daughter got married to the
      heir to a baronetcy; the wedding took place in St. George's, Hanover
      Square, and the <i>Post</i> gave an account of it to the extent of half a
      column, and the <i>Mirror</i> gave photographs of the bride and
      bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would scarcely be believed, except by some one acquainted with the best
      society at Mallingham, that upon this occasion the lady who had displayed
      her skill in snubbing the Latimers sent a two-guinea present to the bride.
      It was understood that the list of presents would appear in the <i>Post;</i>
      but when this list appeared the name of the donor of this special gift was
      absent from it: the two-guinea gift had been promptly returned by the
      mother of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is another touch: the valuable cake basket was returned with a
      heavy dinge in one place, which the jeweller affirms was not there when he
      packed it in tissue paper and shavings in its box with the card bearing
      the inscription: &ldquo;To dear Constance, with best wishes from&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       That is why he refused to take it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the son of this lady whose generosity was so spurned who, on
      leaving the rather second-class public school at which he received a sort
      of education, gravely said to another boy from Mallingham who had also
      just been finished&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I'll often see you at Mallingham, old chap, as we are both
      living there, and I'm sure that I should be very glad to have a chat with
      you now and then; but, of course, you won't expect me to acknowledge you
      if I am walking with my mother or sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the other boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, can't you see that it would never do?&rdquo; said the
      first. &ldquo;You know that your people are not in our set. You can't expect
      that because we happen to have been three years in the same house, we are
      in the same social position at home. But, as you know, there's nothing of
      the snob about me, and any time that we meet in one of the side streets,
      and even at the unfashionable end of High Street, I'll certainly nod to
      you. But that's the farthest that I can be expected to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boy certainly expected him to go very much farther even than the
      unfashionable end of the High Street, and ventured to delimitate the
      boundaries of the place, and to say a word or two respecting its climate
      and the fitness of his companions and all his family for a permanent
      residence there. Being a biggish lad, and enjoying a reputation for being
      opposed to peace at any price, he could express his inmost feelings
      without being deterred by any inconvenient reprisals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not even respond to his exuberance upon this occasion. He
      sulked in the corner of the railway carriage where the conversation took
      place, and he has been sulking ever since.

      IV.&mdash;THE ENTERPRISE OF MALLINGHAM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a gentleman
      who travelled in the latest styles in soft goods who was heard to affirm
      that Mallingham was not a town: it was a dormitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doubtless spoke from the horizon line of soft goods, having in his eye
      certain of those firms who still do business in the concave side of
      ancient bay windows, and have not yet been lured on to fortnightly cheap
      sales behind a sheet of plate-glass. A commercial traveller takes some
      time to recover his selfrespect after importuning a possible client in the
      con-cavity of an eighteenth-century window of what was once a dainty
      parlour, but is now a dingy shop.

      <a href="images/0139.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      But, as a matter of fact, there is a deep and pellucid well of enterprise
      in the centre of commercial circles in Mallingham, and it only wants an
      occasional stir to irrigate the dead levels of the town. For instance,
      there is published by a stationer in the High Street the <i>Mallingham
      Almanac</i>, an annual work which gives a large amount of interesting
      information valuable to many persons in an agricultural district, such as
      the list of fair days in all the villages in the county, the hours of the
      rising and setting of the sun (of undoubted interest to farmers), the
      changes of the moon (also very important to have noted down to the very
      second), the equation of time from day to day (without which we could
      hardly get on at all), the time of high water at London Bridge, and the
      variation of the compass (indispensable to agriculturists). A graver note
      is, however, sounded in the pages devoted to prophecy, after the style of
      the ever veracious Francis Moore, where readers, born when Mercury was in
      the Fourth House, are warned against eating uncooked horse-chestnuts on a
      Friday, and the general public are told that as, in a certain month, Mars
      and Neptune are in opposition&mdash;perhaps it should be apposition&mdash;news
      will be published regarding the German Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there are pages given over wholly to poetry, like Ephraim and his
      idols.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of enterprise which flutters&mdash;I am afraid that I referred
      to it in an earlier paragraph in a way that suggested water which really
      does not flutter,&mdash;as a moth round a flame, round a good advertising
      medium in Mallingham, is shown by the pages of business cards scattered
      throughout the sheets of this almanac.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his Address to his Subscribers which prefaces the last issue, the
      publisher, who is also the editor, recognises in a handsome way the
      support which he has received from his numerous advertisers and expresses
      the earnest hope that they may all, individually and collectively, find
      that their business will rapidly increase as a reward for their
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite page may be read the business cards of three undertakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mallingham is certainly not a dormitory so far as the possibilities of
      trade are concerned. It may safely be said that every business house will
      undertake undertaking in all its branches and the removal of furniture. No
      matter how small may be the apparent connection between the business
      professed on the shop sign and the undertaking industry or the removal
      industry, you will find on inquiry the utmost willingness expressed to
      meet your wishes in either direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The qualification of a dealer in antiques to carry out such a contract is
      not immediately apparent, but it is certainly more apparent than that of
      an auctioneer; at least, if you need to be buried, it is not to an
      auctioneer you will go in the first instance. To be sure, if you read <i>Othello</i>
      carefully you will find that there is quite an intimate connection between
      &ldquo;removals&rdquo; and undertaking; but, as a rule, for business purposes each of
      the two trades is regarded as distinct from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Mallingham you not only find them amalgamated, but both are run
      (decorously) in association with hardware, upholstery, blind-making,
      carpetbeating, life and fire assurance (not at all so extraordinary this
      last named), crockery, and soft goods. It is rumoured that the largest
      business in the &ldquo;lines&rdquo; referred to is in the hands of a rag and bone
      merchant and a dyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pleasant to be able to record that no one has yet been known to
      accept the suggestion of the pun in regard to the aptitude of the dyer in
      such a connection, and it is certain that Shakespeare himself would not
      have been able to resist the temptation. But Shakespeare has said many
      things that no one in Mallingham would care to invent or even to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most notable instances of the professional enterprise of
      Mallingham was told to me by its victim. He was a clergyman, and the
      curate of one of the parishes. Now there are curates who are as fully
      qualified to discharge the duties of their calling as is a Rector, or even
      a Rural Dean: some of those whom we find in the country have &ldquo;walked the
      hospitals,&rdquo; so to speak, having been for years labouring in the slums of a
      large town; but some are what might be termed only &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; men, and it
      was a &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; curate who, on taking up his duties in Mallingham, set
      about a zealous house-to-house visitation, being determined to become
      personally acquainted with every member of his flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already made some headway in the course he had mapped out for
      himself, and was becoming greatly liked for his sociability before he had
      reached the letter R in his visiting list, at the head of which was the
      name of Mr. Walter Ritchie, the dentist, a gentleman who, in addition to
      enjoying an excellent practice as a destructive rather than a constructive
      artist, was a good Churchman. It was between the hours of twelve and one
      that the zealous curate found it convenient to call upon him, and he was
      promptly shown into the waiting-room, where there was an elderly lady with
      a slightly swollen face studying the pages of a very soiled <i>Graphic</i>
      of three weeks old. Of her company he was, however, bereft within the
      space of a few minutes, and the <i>Graphic</i> was available for his
      entertainment for the next quarter of an hour. Then the maid returned and
      said that Mr. Ritchie would see him now, and he followed her across the
      passage and was shown into the usual operating room of the second-class
      practitioner of the country town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ritchie greeted him warmly and so volubly as saved the clergyman the
      need for introducing any of the professional inanities which are supposed
      to smooth the way to an honourable <i>rapprochement</i> be-ween a pastor
      and an unknown member of his pastorate. The parson had not really a word
      to say when Mr. Ritchie got upon the topic of teeth, and warned his
      visitor that he must be very careful in his use of the Mallingham water
      until he should get accustomed to it. It had an injurious effect upon the
      natural enamel of the teeth of the lower jaw, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain to you what I mean, if you will kindly sit here,&rdquo; he
      added, pointing to the iron-framed chair, the shape of which expresses the
      most excruciating comfort to a dentist's clientele. The curate, wishing to
      be all things to all men, though he had no intention of being a dentist's
      &ldquo;example,&rdquo; smiled and seated himself. In an instant Mr. Ritchie had him in
      his power; bending over him, he gently scraped away some of the &ldquo;enamel&rdquo;
       from one of his front teeth and, exhibiting a speck on the end of the
      steel scraper, explained the chemical changes which an unguarded use of
      the chalky water of the town supply would have upon that substance, though
      it made no difference to the secretions of the glands of the upper jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very interesting and civil, if somewhat &ldquo;shoppy,&rdquo; of Mr. Ritchie,
      the clergyman thought, and once more opened his mouth to allow of the
      dentist's obtaining a sample of the alkaline deposit to which he had
      alluded. But the moment his jaws were apart Mr. Ritchie made a sound as of
      a sudden indrawing of his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, what have we here?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Nasty, nasty! but not too far gone&mdash;no,
      I sincerely hope, not too far gone. One moment.&rdquo; He had inserted a little
      shield-shaped mirror in the curate's mouth and was pressing it gently
      against an upper tooth. &ldquo;Ah yes, as I thought&mdash;a little stuffing will
      save it. Nerve exposed. You are quite right to come to me at once. A
      stitch in time, you know. It will hardly require any drilling&mdash;only
      at the rough edges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman was not the man to protest against Mr. Ritchie's civilities.
      He admitted that the tooth had given him some trouble the previous year,
      but he had not thought it worth consulting a dentist about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the mistake that people make,&rdquo; said Mr. Ritchie mournfully. &ldquo;They
      usually associate a visit to their dentist with some atrocity&mdash;some
      moments of agony&mdash;that was the result of the old tradition, dating
      back to John Leech's days. Of course, in those dark ages dentists did not
      exist, whereas now&mdash;&mdash; I think I would do well to do a little
      crown work between the tooth I am stopping and the next: the gap between
      the two is certain to work mischief before many months are over, and the
      back of the nearest molar has become so worn through the pressure of that
      overgrown one below it that, if not checked in time, it will break off
      with you some fine day. I'm glad that you came to me to-day. I will make a
      new man of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the little ingenious emery drill working away before the clergyman
      remembered that he had not come to pay a professional visit to the dentist&mdash;that
      is to say, he had meant that his visit should be a professional one so far
      as his own profession went, but not that it should be a professional one
      so far as the profession of the other man went. But it seemed to him that
      the dentist was fast approaching the moment when he, the dentist, would
      not be amenable to the <i>convenances</i> of the parochial visit, but
      would become completely absorbed in the <i>nuances</i> of dental science
      which every revolution of the emery drill seemed to be revealing. He could
      say nothing. He was in an unaccustomed posture for speech. He was lying in
      the steely embrace of that highly nickelised chair, with his face looking
      up to the ceiling&mdash;exactly the reverse of the attitude in which he
      felt so fluent every Sunday evening. With his head bending over the top of
      his pulpit, he felt that he was equal to explaining everything in heaven
      above or the earth beneath; but sprawling back, with his eyes on the
      ceiling, and a thing whizzing like a cockchafer in his mouth, he was
      incapable of protest, even when he had recovered himself sufficiently to
      feel that a protest might be judicious, if not actually effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      He submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next four weeks he was, off and on, in the hands of Mr. Ritchie.
      It seemed as he went on that he had not a really sound tooth in his head,
      though he told me, almost tearfully, that previously he had always prided
      himself on his excellent teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mr. Ritchie went too far in the end,&rdquo; he added, recapitulating
      the main incidents of his indictment of the dentist. &ldquo;I dare say a couple
      of my molars were showing signs of wear and tear, and so were all the
      better for being filled in properly; and it is quite likely that the gulf
      between the other two was the better for being bridged over&mdash;possibly
      a flake or two needed to be ground away from one of the grinders at the
      back&mdash;but I am sure that the time occupied in correcting some of the
      other irregularities which he perceived, but which had never caused me a
      moment's inconvenience, might have been better spent. I often thought so;
      but I said nothing until he calmly advised me to have six of my upper jaw
      painlessly extracted, apparently for no other reason than to show me how
      the new system of injecting cocaine, or something, worked, and that he
      could do what he called 'crown work' with the best dentists at
      Brindlington&mdash;then I thought it time to speak out, and I did speak
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you say to him?&rdquo; I inquired, for I longed to be put in touch
      with the phraseology of a &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; parson when speaking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't spare him: I told him just what I thought of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did that amount to? Nothing grossly offensive, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't careful of my words; I did not weigh them. If they sounded
      offensive to him I cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say to him, as nearly as you can recollect? I'm rather a
      connoisseur of language and I may be able to relieve your mind, if you
      have any uneasiness on the subject of the man's feelings when you had done
      with him. What did you say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him plainly that I thought he had gone too far; and now, looking
      at the whole transaction from a purely impersonal standpoint, I am not
      disposed to withdraw a single word of what I said. He did go too far&mdash;I
      honestly believe it. You will understand that it is not easy for one to
      take up an attitude of complete detachment in considering a matter such as
      this in all its bearings; but I think that I have disciplined myself
      sufficiently to be able to consider it in an unprejudiced spirit, and
      really I do believe that he went too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he did, you certainly did not,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Has he sent you in his bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not his bill that matters&mdash;it only comes to £5, 11s. 6d. What
      I objected to was his implication that I had not a sound tooth in my head&mdash;I
      that have been accustomed during the past five years to crack nuts&mdash;not
      mere filberts, mind, but the sort that come from Brazil&mdash;at all the
      school feasts without the need for crackers! Just think of it! Oh yes, he
      certainly went too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with him; I had no idea that there was so much enterprise in all
      Mallingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general idea that prevails in regard to Mallingham is that it has
      remained stagnant&mdash;except for its aspirations after plate-glass&mdash;during
      the past four or five hundred years of its existence. A dog of some sort
      lies asleep at midday under almost every shop window, and cats of all
      sorts may be seen crossing the High Street at almost any hour. That is how
      it comes that the town seems so charming to visitors, and to those of its
      inhabitants who are not engaged in business.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being so, I was disposed to laugh at the sly humour of a man and his
      wife&mdash;they were Russian nobles who motored across from Brindlington
      to lunch with us at Thurswell&mdash;who said they had enjoyed the drive
      exceedingly, until they had come to Mallingham. &ldquo;A horrid, rowdy place,
      like the East End of London on Saturday night,&rdquo; were the exact words those
      visitors employed, and I had actually begun to laugh at their ironical
      humour when I saw that they were meant to be in earnest. For some time I
      was in a state of perplexity; but then the truth suddenly flashed upon me:
      it was the day of the Mallingham Races&mdash;one of the three days of the
      year when the dogs are not allowed to sleep in the streets and when the
      cats remain indoors, when the High Street is for a full hour after the
      arrival of the train crowded with all that it disgorges, and when there is
      a stream of vehicles carrying to the picturesque racecourse on the Downs
      the usual supporters of the turf, with redfaced bookmakers and their
      &ldquo;pitches,&rdquo; as objectionable a crew as may be encountered in the streets of
      any country town at any season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that my friends had reached the High Street of Mallingham a
      few minutes after the arrival of the train, and not being aware of the
      exceptional circumstances which had galvanised the place into life for a
      brief twenty minutes, they had assumed that this was the normal aspect of
      the town! I did my best to remove from Mallingham the reproach of being
      the great centre of bustling life that it had seemed to these strangers;
      but I could see that I did not altogether succeed in convincing them that,
      except for four days out of the year, nothing happens in Mallingham&mdash;three
      days of races and one night of loyal revelry&mdash;for even the holding of
      the Assizes three times a year does not cause the town to awake from its
      immemorial repose. The trumpets sound as the judge drives up to the County
      Hall with a mounted escort, and the shopkeepers come to their doors and
      glance down the street; the sleeping dogs jump up and begin to bark in a
      half-hearted way, but settle themselves comfortably down again before the
      last note of the fanfare has passed away, and, except for an occasional
      glimpse of a man in a wig crossing the street to the hotel, the Assize
      week passes much the same as any other week of the uneventful year. Three
      hundred years have passed since anything happened in Mallingham, and then
      it was nothing worth talking about. One must go back seven hundred years
      to find the town the centre of an historical incident of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rumour is that Messrs. Williamson &amp; Rubble, drapers and
      outfitters, are about to have a new plate-glass front made for both their
      shops, with convex corners and roll-up shutters; so Mallingham marches
      onward from century to century&mdash;slowly.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;THE MODERN METHODS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE MILD AND
      BASHFUL ENTERPRISE of Mallingham is made to look ridiculous when
      contrasted with the unblushing business energy of Burford, that bustling
      town of twenty thousand inhabitants at the farther end of Nethershire.
      Burford lends itself as an awful example of what can be accomplished by
      that dynamic element known as &ldquo;push.&rdquo; It was born picturesque, but has
      since become prosperous. Its Corporation has long ago done away with all
      those features of interest to antiquarians which are ineradicable in
      Mallington, however earnestly the ambitious Council of the latter may
      labour for their annihilation; so although strangers knowing something of
      the early history of Burford, come to it expecting to find it the &ldquo;dear
      old quaint place&rdquo; of the girl with the camera, they bicycle away before
      accepting the hospitality offered by the bill of fare displayed in the
      broad windows of the double-fronted modern restaurant lately set up by
      Messrs. Caterham &amp; Co., of London, where the old conduit house,
      mentioned in the guide-books, stood for centuries, in the High Street. The
      Corporation are, it is rumoured, meditating the advisability of altering
      the name of the High Street into the King's Parade. The sooner they make a
      move in this direction the better it will be for all concerned; for
      undoubtedly, as the Mayor recently pointed out, the town has passed out of
      the category of towns with a High Street, and may claim to be admitted
      into the select circle of those with their Royal Avenues and Princes'
      Promenades.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why not make a bold step forward with King's Parade?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      The invasion of Burford by Messrs. Caterham, with their score of little
      marble tables and a choice of four dishes for luncheon, was equivalent to
      putting the seal of modernity upon the old High Street; but its claim to
      compete in its extent of plate-glass frontage with the most advanced
      centres of business enterprise, was long ago proved by the establishment
      of Messrs. Shenstone's fine &ldquo;drapery emporium&rdquo; (vide advertisements) on
      the site of the old Castlegate Inn. It is said that even in the difficult
      matter of supplying sables to suit all classes of customers this house can
      hold its own with any in the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A customer enters with an inquiry for a set of sables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward furs,&rdquo; the shopwalker commands&mdash;he actually is a full
      corporal in the Territorials&mdash;and the lady finds herself confronted
      at the counter by a young man with a Bond Street frock-coat and a Regent
      Street smile, who says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sables, madam? Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaves her for a few moments and returns with an armful of furs, which
      he displays, laying each piece over his arm and smoothing it down as if it
      were&mdash;well, a sort of cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, madam?&rdquo; He refers to a ticket. &ldquo;Two hundred guineas, madam&mdash;all
      Russian. Something not quite so expensive? Certainly, madam.&rdquo; Once again
      he goes away and returns with another armful. &ldquo;These are quite superior
      furs, madam. Real sable? Certainly, madam, real Musquash sable. Sixty-five
      pounds. Something cheaper, madam? Certainly. I have a very nice line of
      inexpensive sables that I think you will like.&rdquo; He beckons to a young lady
      farther up the counter, and she brings him a bundle of tawny skins, which
      he displays as before. &ldquo;A very nice line, madam&mdash;very chaste and
      showy. Real sable? Oh, certainly&mdash;real electric sable, every piece.
      Price, madam? Nine guineas, including muff. Something cheaper still?
      Certainly, madam.&rdquo; He climbs up a small and handy ladder and lifts down a
      large pasteboard box full of furs. &ldquo;These, madam&mdash;very tasteful&mdash;large
      amount of wear&mdash;sell a great number of these. Real sable? Certainly,
      madam, real rabbit sable, thirty-nine and eleven. Something rather less?
      Certainly, madam.&rdquo; He pulls down another box, takes off the lid, and
      exposes skins. &ldquo;Nice lot these, madam, very highly thought of&mdash;largely
      worn in London this season. Real sable, madam? Certainly, madam&mdash;real
      ox-tail sable, ten and six the set. Shall we send them? Thank you. What
      name, please? Johnston&mdash;with the t? Thank you. And the next article,
      madam? Oh yes, this afternoon for certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is the sort of business house you find in the High Street, Burford,
      in these days; so that there can hardly be a doubt that it is time the
      thoroughfare changed its name to King's Parade. If people want genuine
      ox-tail sables they will go to a King's Parade for it much more readily
      than they would to a High Street. But there is a deeper depth in sables
      that a customer can only reach in a Royal Avenue; this is the genuine
      charwoman's sable at three and eleven, muff included. Messrs. Shenstone
      &amp; Co. are, however, select and conscientious; they will not sell you
      as the real article anything that will not bear the closest scrutiny, and
      their ox-tail sable marks the limit to which they will go. It may be
      foolish in these go-ahead days to have any scruples, but Messrs. Shenstone
      are ready to submit to any reproach rather than to give a customer,
      however humble, a misleading description of any article.

      II.&mdash;LIBRARIANS WHILE YOU WAIT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s a matter of
      course, Burford has a Public Library of its own. The Corporation had a
      chance of acquiring a library that had been in existence for some years:
      it had been built as a memorial to her husband by a wealthy lady in the
      neighbourhood, and it contained several thousand volumes of the
      &ldquo;improving&rdquo; sort which were so much in favour with fathers and mothers and
      uncles and aunts&mdash;in fact, with all manner of people except readers&mdash;fifty
      or sixty years ago. For purposes of a public library such a collection is
      absurd, and should have been consigned to one of the Corporation's rubbish
      carts without delay, together with its Encyclopaedias dated 1812. The
      books were, however, allowed to encumber the shelves, and there they
      remain unto this day, to assist in the culture of much that would interest
      an earnest bacteriologist. To the majority of the members of the
      Corporation, however, &ldquo;a book's a book although there's nothing in it,&rdquo;
       and their &ldquo;library&rdquo; is packed with books and bacteria, both happily
      undisturbed for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time ago a charwoman with a husband was required to sweep the floors
      and put the daily papers in their proper frames, and so the Corporation
      advertised for a &ldquo;librarian&rdquo; and his wife, mentioning the &ldquo;salary&rdquo; at
      fifty pounds a year. But they did not add, as they might have done, &ldquo;no
      knowledge of books required,&rdquo; and the consequence was that at the annual
      meeting of the Library Association the distinguished President referred to
      the advertisement with disparaging comments in respect of the &ldquo;salary&rdquo;
       offered to the &ldquo;librarian.&rdquo; It was not likely that such a reflection upon
      the liberality of the Corporation of Burford would be allowed to go to the
      world with impunity, so a member who considered himself responsible for
      the advertisement and the fixing of the renumeration wrote to the papers,
      pointing out that caretaker's rooms were granted to the &ldquo;librarian&rdquo; in
      addition to his &ldquo;salary,&rdquo; so that the Corporation were really munificent
      in their offer; but whether they were so or not, they could get plenty of
      people to discharge the duties of &ldquo;librarian&rdquo; on the conditions set down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite right. The applicants for the coveted post were numerous.
      They represented all the out-of-work men in the neighbourhood. Porters,
      jobbing gardeners, discharged soldiers with the rank of private, and the
      usual casuals applied, and the most eligible of these seemed to be an
      ex-soldier: &ldquo;We should do all we can for old army men,&rdquo; said one of the
      Committee very properly, and so the old soldier stood at attention,
      saluted, and became a &ldquo;librarian.&rdquo; The ability of the Corporation of
      Burford must be admired: they can make any man a librarian in five
      minutes; though the general opinion that prevails on the subject is that
      long years of careful training are needed to qualify even a man of good
      education for the post of librarian!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is where the management of a matter that makes no appeal to the
      illiterate becomes a farce in the hands of such a body. What they wanted
      was a charwoman with a husband, not a librarian with a wife; but with
      traditional pomposity they must needs advertise for a &ldquo;librarian&rdquo; with a
      &ldquo;salary.&rdquo; So far as I can gather, the caretaker can sweep out a library
      with any man; but if you ask for any particular book&mdash;well, he does
      his best. But a man may be an adept with brooms and yet a tyro with books.
      He is another of the things that are not what they seem at Burford.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;ARCHÆOLOGICAL ENTERPRISE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is quite a
      good Museum at Burford. It was formed, I believe, in the pre-Corporation
      days, and so it is under intelligent control. Local antiquities are
      represented with some attempt at completeness and classification, and its
      educational value would be very great if the people of the neighbourhood
      could be induced to give to it some of the time that they devote to
      football. A few years ago, however, an irresistible appeal was made to the
      culture of the town by the acquisition for the collections of a human hand
      from the Solomon Islands. As soon as it was understood that this treasure
      had just been added to those in the Museum there was a rush to see it, and
      thousands of persons paid their sixpences for a glance at it, and in the
      course of a day or two after its arrival it had become the topic of the
      place. If you had not seen it you were regarded as a complete outsider. It
      was considered a great hardship that visitors were not allowed to touch
      this exhibit; for, after all, a look at such an object is unsatisfactory&mdash;quite
      different from a hearty handshake. To shake such a hand would be
      satisfying, it was generally thought, and I have much pleasure in
      associating myself with such an expression of opinion. A little of it
      would satisfy any but the most grasping nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this Museum that there reposed for years in one of its glass
      cases an interesting exhibit labelled &ldquo;Fragment of ancient pottery,
      probably Saxon, effects of lead glazing still visible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was thought to be part of a pitcher, and some ingenious and imaginative
      antiquary had made an excellent drawing of the original vessel, showing
      the bulge in the body from which the piece had been broken. Many papers
      had been written about the fragment, some authorities contending that it
      was not of Saxon but Roman origin, and others that, as it had been found
      on a part of the coast which had at one time been covered by the sea, it
      was almost certain to be of Scandinavian origin: it had been on board one
      of the Norse pirate galleys that had harried the whole of the South Coast,
      and marks were pointed out along the edge which were said to be the traces
      of a rude decoration of Scandinavian design.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years the controversy was carried on with a large display of learning
      on all sides, until one day a geologist of distinction visited the Museum,
      and announced that the specimen of pottery was a section of a human skull.
      A little examination and a comparison of the specimen with an ordinary
      human skull showed beyond the possibility of doubt that this view was the
      correct one, and the label was changed without delay. But when it became
      known that the Museum was in possession of part of a human skull, it was
      visited by hundreds of people all anxious to get a glimpse of so
      interesting an object, and if possible&mdash;but this was rather too much
      to hope for&mdash;to hold it in their hands; and for weeks the contents of
      other cases lay unnoticed. The broken skull was the real attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an amazingly thick skull: if it had not been so thick it would
      probably not have led its original owner to forfeit it, but would have
      suggested to him a way of escape from those unfriendly persons who had
      deprived him of its use. But the owner would certainly have made a good
      show at an old election fight, or have reached a green old age in
      Tipperary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once saw on a shelf in the Museum a piece of old ironwork in the form of
      a rushlight holder. So it was labelled, and the date 1609 assigned to it.
      It was stated on the label that it was probably the work of a well-known
      ironworker of the neighbourhood in which it had been found. I ventured,
      however, to differ from this last suggestion, the fact being that this
      particular example of seventeenth-century ironwork was not made during
      that century or by that craftsman, but by a more crafty person during the
      latter years of the reign of Edward the Seventh. My reason for coming to
      this conclusion was not the result of the possession on my part of any
      special acquaintance with wrought-iron or the methods of the old workers,
      but simply because I had been present when the thing was in course of
      being forged&mdash;in both senses <i>forged.</i> The craftsman had been
      called away from his job suddenly, and when I entered his unostentatious
      forge there the thing was lying as he had left it, in an unfinished
      condition. Some days later I saw it among a heap of scrap iron of various
      sorts in his yard, and it rather took my fancy. I pulled it forth and
      asked the man if he had any idea what it was. He replied that, so far as
      he could remember, an antiquarian gentleman had told him that it was for
      holding a rushlight. I looked at it closely and said that I did not think
      it was old, and he replied that he didn't believe it to be very old
      either; but it wasn't a handsome thing anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw it down and began to talk about other matters, and the next I saw
      of it was in the Museum above its neatly lettered label.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the craftsman where I had seen it, and he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that there are people who know more about these ancient old
      things than us, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man that has a great fancy for his own
      opinion came round here shortly after you were here, and I could see that
      he had his eye on that thing, though it was lying among the scraps; and
      when he had talked long enough to put me off thinking that it had caught
      his eye, he picked it up and asked me what I would take for it. I told him
      half a sovereign, and he beat me down to three half-crowns. Then he sold
      it to Anson in the Corn-market for a pound, and Anson took it to the
      Museum and got thirty-five shillings for it. That's the whole story. The
      others got a good bit more out of it than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a shame,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;considering that you made it, you should have
      had the largest share of the profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't complain. What would be the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the same neighbourhood there is another excellent workman. He has
      always in the backyard of his house quite a number of antique Sussex
      firebacks maturing. He lays down firebacks as wise people lay down wine to
      mature. They look absurdly clean and fresh when they come from the place
      where he casts them, but time and the oxide of iron soon remedy all those
      defects, and when they have been lying rusting for a month or two the
      aspect of the design is changed. A rough scrubbing&mdash;not too much, but
      just enough&mdash;and an exposure in a brisk fire to produce the marks of
      long years of duty in the sturdy old yeoman's grate, with the crane
      swinging over it, and another specimen of the Sussex fireback is ready for
      the market. The market is always ready. It will take the sturdy old
      yeoman's crane, with its hooks and its levers, as well as his fireback,
      and so the industry of the craftsman and the craft of the dealer man are
      stimulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is still a brisk trade done in the manufacture of ancient flint
      weapons&mdash;hatchets, spear barbs, arrow-heads, and the like&mdash;in
      our county, though I have heard that there has been a melancholy falling
      off in the volume of business done in this particular line during the past
      twenty years. It is never well to be too certain about the treasures one
      acquires nowadays, either in iron or flaky flint, but I have heard that
      long ago a collector had quite as great reason to be cautious. A large
      number of interesting flint weapons were with reasonable luck to be
      dredged out of the sand and mud of some rivers. It was only reasonable to
      suppose that these things had some thousands of years ago been in active
      use in battles fought at the ford, and that they had remained undisturbed
      for centuries in the bed of the river. I heard of an eminent archaeologist
      having acquired quite a number of these implements bearing unmistakable
      signs of antiquity. They had been dredged out of the Thames from time to
      time, he heard. Unfortunately he mentioned this fact to a dealer who had
      also heard of these dredgings, and offered to lend him the collection for
      examination. The first experiment upon them was the last. They had only to
      be boiled in a strong solution of soda to have their true character&mdash;their
      false character&mdash;revealed. When taken out of the kettle the things
      were as fresh as if made the day before. They had not been made the day
      before, but they had certainly been made within the year. They were
      nothing more than flaky fakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it is safer for a tradesman to use his own imagination in the
      preparation of his wares than to ask his customers to use theirs. For
      instance a dealer in curious things, in Burford, seeing some funny wooden
      dolls in a shop window, bought the whole five and then used up some scraps
      of old brocade and remnants of Genoa velvet in dressing them in costumes
      to be found in the recognised authority. He exposed them for sale sitting
      in a row, and very amazing they must have appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quaint things, are they not? Mediaeval puppets. I don't know that I ever
      saw the like before. Of course you see what they are meant to represent?
      Why, the Five Senses, to be sure. Fifteen guineas for the five. If I don't
      sell them at once I'll send them to the Victoria and Albert Museum.
      They'll jump at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't mind buying one of them,&rdquo; said the customer; &ldquo;but I could not
      do with the whole five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, sir; but you could scarcely ask me to break the set&mdash;I don't
      believe there is another set in existence,&rdquo; said the dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might let me have one. I have bought a lot of things from you
      from time to time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to, sir&mdash;yes, I should indeed like you to have one,
      but&mdash;you see the whole beauty of the set is that it is a set&mdash;the
      Five Senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some further conversation ensued, and at last the dealer showed himself to
      be less inflexible than he had been at first, and the customer secured one
      of the mediaeval curiosities for four pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later another customer called and duly inspected the four
      remaining dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very curious, sir&mdash;very unique, I think. Of course you see the idea,
      sir&mdash;the Four Seasons. Fifteenth-century Venetian, I should say. You
      can see the bit of brocade&mdash;old Venetian beyond a question. I wish I
      had half a dozen yards of it. Twenty guineas I'm asking for the set. I'm
      afraid I couldn't break the set. It's hardly fair to ask me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But eventually he yielded to the importunity of the customer and got five
      guineas for a second of his creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular things, sir&mdash;Early Italian Church puppets beyond doubt.
      They used to dress them fantastically and stand them on the altar, I
      believe. You observe the symbolic character of the set, sir&mdash;the
      Trinity. Votive offerings and that, you know. Even in the present day you
      see such things at wayside shrines in Catholic countries. I'm afraid it
      would spoil the set to sell one out of the three, sir. You had better take
      the three now that you have the chance. Very unique, I call them, and only
      eighteen pounds for the three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man had no use for the three, and after some haggling he got the
      one he wanted for £5, 10s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there were two,&rdquo; as the story of the ten little nigger boys has
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Church pieces, madam. Fourteenth-century Spanish&mdash;the embroidery is
      Spanish, I am sure. I wish I had a yard of it. Adam and Eve they are meant
      to represent,&rdquo; etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if no one could do with more than one of these &ldquo;very unique&rdquo;
       treasures; so he was forced to let the lady separate our first parents,
      paying five pounds for making the divorce decree absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the week he had sold a unique example of a Flemish doll&mdash;&ldquo;One
      may see the like in some of Teniers' pictures. They treasure them up from
      generation to generation in the houses of the old nobility. It is very
      rarely that one gets into the market. You see they regard it as a matter
      of family honour never to sell one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sold it for six pounds, and took his wife to a theatre where, curiously
      enough, the diverting play of <i>La Poupée</i> was being performed. It is
      a diverting play, but not, I think, &ldquo;absolutely unique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be gathered from these instances of local business enterprise how
      amply the modern spirit of making the most of one's opportunities of
      &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; is represented among the commercial population of Burford.
      Its manufacturers may be divided into two classes: the makers and the
      fakers, and it is generally understood that the latter make the most
      money.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;THE ILLUSTRIOUS STRANGER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL THINGS ARE NOT
      WHAT THEY SEEM at Burford, as I have ventured to suggest. But the majority
      of the inhabitants think that they are. Probably at one time they were;
      but with the development of the spirit of modern enterprise in the town a
      new complexion has been put upon various features associated with the
      daily life of the place, so that one needs to go beneath the surface of
      things in general in order to find out what they really are.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was literally the new complexion put upon a very ordinary commercial
      undertaking that caused some of the most self-respecting of the
      inhabitants to forget themselves upon one occasion a year or two ago. To
      be sure, they had done nothing that should have caused even the most
      susceptible a qualm; but they thought they had, and this impression was
      strengthened by the attitude of a good many of their friends, so that the
      result was just as unpleasant to them as if they had been guilty of some
      gross piece of foolishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances of this new complexion must be dealt with in detail in
      order to be fully appreciated by people outside Burford.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an announcement appeared in the local newspapers that the town would
      shortly be visited by a distinguished Hindu, the Cachar of Darjeeling, a
      considerable amount of excitement was caused in the best circles of
      Burford Society&mdash;the best circles, it is scarcely necessary to say,
      are those that have their centre somewhere in the new quarter, the bright
      red-brick villa quarter of the town&mdash;and every one was inquiring what
      Mrs. Paston would do in the matter. Mrs. Paston had obtained in many
      quarters an ample recognition of her authority as <i>arbiter elegantarium</i>,
      and her lead in social matters was regarded as inevitable even by those
      who could not conscientiously accept her dicta as the last word on every
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will Mrs. Paston do when the Cachar of Darjeeling comes to Burford?
      That was the question which people asked of one another over cups of tea
      with occasional muffins; and the result of many conferences under these or
      similar conditions was a resolution that a deputation of ladies appointed
      themselves to wait on her, one at a time, to learn what she really meant
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed that Mrs. Paston had not quite made up her mind on the
      matter. The Cachar of Darjeeling is, of course, a prince&mdash;quite as
      much a prince as the others one hears about&mdash;begums, sowdars, rajahs,
      jams, ranees, gaekwars, khansamahs&mdash;all referred to by Mr. Kipling;
      and, of course, being a prince, he was, <i>ex officio</i>, eligible to be
      received even by the best people in Burford. To be sure, she had heard it
      said that&mdash;that&mdash;but for that matter there was as much
      wickedness at home, if people only took the trouble to look for it; and
      there was no need for people with daughters to put them forward in the
      presence of distinguished strangers, whether Indian princes or Austrian
      counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was how Mrs. Paston took the various deputations of one into her
      confidence when they endeavoured to find out what she meant to do in
      regard to the coming visit of the distinguished Oriental, and they
      interpreted her mystic phrases as meaning that she meant to keep the
      Prince to herself. Within a few days the Cachar had come to be alluded to
      as &ldquo;the Prince.&rdquo; In the English provinces practically every man of colour
      is accepted as a prince&mdash;it is a courtesy title, pretty much the same
      as the title of Madame which goes with a bonnet shop in the West End. Even
      the dusky person who accompanies the clergyman to the platform when a
      lecture is about to be given upon missionary work in the East, is referred
      to as &ldquo;the Prince&rdquo; that being the sanctioned English equivalent to his
      native title, which conveys nothing to the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it seemed pretty clear that Mrs. Paston intended to keep the
      distinguished visitor to herself&mdash;that was why she made herself
      ambiguous when approached on the subject of his reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other authorities besides Mrs. Pas-ton, and one of them was
      Mrs. Maxwell. She was the wife of a retired Indian Civil Servant, and the
      <i>quasi</i> Reception Committee showed some eagerness to learn what her
      attitude would be in regard to the coming Cachar of Darjeeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Maxwell said that her husband thought there had as usual been
      some misprint or mixing up of words in the paper, for he had never heard
      of the Cachar of Darjeeling; though there was a place named Cachar, and it
      was in Darjeeling, and very likely there was a prince or whatever they
      chose to call him in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not getting much farther on in the solution of the question that
      agitated the red-tiled group of Burford Society. It was pointed out by one
      sagacious lady that the fact of there being a place named Cachar in
      Darjeeling did not make it impossible that there should be a title of
      Cachar. They had not to go far from home for an example of this. Was there
      not a Lochiel in Scotland, and yet Lochiel was a place? Was there not a
      Magillicuddy in Ireland, and Magillicuddy was a mountain? It was pretty
      obvious that both Mrs. Maxwell and Mrs. Paston were temporising with the
      Committee; each was doing her best to put the others off the idea of
      leaving cards upon the Cachar, hoping to take him under her own wing and
      keep him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the opinion of more than one of the inquirers, and a good deal of
      bitterness was occasioned by the reticence of the leaders. But no one
      seemed to know what was the object of the Princes visit to Burford, how
      long it was going to last, or with whom he meant to stay.

      II.&mdash;THE PRINCE'S PARADE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd then suddenly a
      stranger of dusky complexion and wearing flowing robes and a splendid
      turban set with precious stones appeared on foot in the High Street. He
      seemed greatly interested in the place, for he kept parading the leading
      thoroughfare and several of its byways practically the whole of the
      morning, so that he could scarcely escape the notice of all the residents
      who were in the town; no one failed to see him or to learn that he had
      taken lunch at Messrs. Caterham's new restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Mrs. Paston drove up to Caterham's. She inquired of one of
      the young ladies if the Cachar had rooms in the adjoining hotel, and
      learned that he was resting in the private room at the back of the
      restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She at once sent in her card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she done so when Mrs. Lake entered and greeted her&mdash;Mrs.
      Lake was another of the red-tiled residents&mdash;saying&mdash;&ldquo;I hear
      that the Prince is here. I suppose you have sent your card to him&mdash;I
      am sending mine. It is our duty, I think, to show some civility to such a
      visitor. My brother, you know, is intimately associated with India&mdash;Woods
      and Forests, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her card to the young lady, and smiled at Mrs. Paston in a way
      that was meant to assure her that she was mistaken if she fancied that she
      was to have the Prince all to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that the Prince will be delighted to hear that your brother is
      in&mdash;&mdash; What did you say he was in?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Paston sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woods and Forests&mdash;the most important Department in all India,&rdquo; said
      the other. &ldquo;My brother would never forgive me if I allowed the Prince to
      come here without showing him some civility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were going together to the door when they found themselves face to
      face with Mrs. Markham and her daughter, both dressed as if for a garden
      party, and close behind them came Major Sowerby of the Territorials and
      his son, for whom he had been unsuccessfully trying to get a billet for
      the previous two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you here, Mrs. Paston,&rdquo; cried the Major heartily. &ldquo;Yes, I
      maintain that it is our duty to welcome&mdash;to stretch out a right hand
      of greeting to the natives of our great Dependency&mdash;one Empire&mdash;one
      Flag&mdash;hands across the sea&mdash;that's what I have always advocated.
      I am wondering if he couldn't do something for my Teddy here. I believe
      these rajahs and memsahibs and cachars have got no end of money&mdash;rupees&mdash;the
      old Pagoda tree and that. Teddy can turn his hand to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of his excellent patriotic sentiments was interrupted by
      the arrival of nearly all the members of the Committee of inquiry, and a
      card-case was in the hand of every one of them, and other ladies of the
      élite were hurrying down the street, plainly making the restaurant their
      objective. Within a quarter of an hour a whole salver of cards had been
      taken charge of by the young lady, some of them bearing a few pencilled
      words: &ldquo;Hoping to be honoured by a visit,&rdquo; &ldquo;At home every day this week at
      4,&rdquo; &ldquo;Trusting to obtain permission to receive H.H. the Cachar,&rdquo; and the
      like. Mrs. Lake had written on hers, &ldquo;Sister of Mr. George Barnes, Woods
      and Forests Dept.,&rdquo; and Major Sowerby had put in parenthesis under his
      son's name, &ldquo;Ellison prizeman at Routilla College, Eastbourne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Prince appeared once again promenading the High Street.
      He was a man of fine presence, of a rich ruddy brown complexion and a
      black beard and moustache, and his turban was a sight! It contained a
      central diamond little inferior in size to the Koh-i-noor, and on each
      side of it was a pigeon's egg ruby&mdash;a lady who saw it called it a
      pigeon's blood ruby lest there should be any mistake: a casual glance of
      some one who did not know all about these great jewels might convey the
      impression that it was only a bantam's blood ruby, which was quite an
      inferior stone. He had an air of distinction which caused him to be
      greatly admired, and yet he was so devoid of any foolish pride that he did
      not hesitate to chat quite pleasantly to one of the young ladies in
      Caterham's. (Mrs! Paston, hearing this, expressed the hope that the young
      lady would be very careful. But Major Sowerby, when it reached his ears,
      said he hoped the Prince would be careful. Mrs. Markham said nothing, but
      glanced hopefully at her daughter.)

    <p>
      All the ladies remained under their rosy tiles that afternoon, and all the
      maids were supplied with the whitest of caps and aprons. Tea was delayed
      in every house for three-quarters of an hour: there was no knowing what
      might happen. But nothing happened. The Cachar of Darjeeling was clearly
      feeling the embarrassment of having to respond to a welcome offered in
      such plurality; though Mrs. Paston thought that surely one of the young
      ladies in Caterham's would have told him to whom he should give precedence
      in making his calls. Every other lady was of the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Paston thought it but right that she should give the Prince some
      encouragement, so she wrote a little note to him inviting his confidence
      as to his plans, and hoping that he might be able to lunch with her the
      next day, when she would have great pleasure in driving him to Lady
      Collingby's annual Flower Show. Four other ladies addressed notes to him
      expressing precisely the same sentiments, and all set out to deliver them
      at Caterham's with their own hands, to save the delay of a post.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered Caterham's almost simultaneously, without noticing that the
      hoarding which had been built about the next door premises while a
      plate-glass front of noble design was being set in its place had been
      removed. And when they inquired for the Cachar, the young lady said&mdash;&ldquo;He
      is in the new shop&mdash;you go through the arch on the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a Norman arch of lath and plaster enriched by insets of highly
      decorated Lincrusta&mdash;the paper-hangmen had just left it&mdash;in the
      partition wall; through it the ladies went and found themselves in a
      spacious shop with a profusion of cheap specimens of Oriental china on
      lacquer brackets about the walls, and an all-pervading smell of freshly
      roasted coffee. It was clearly the newly acquired premises of the
      enterprising Messrs. Caterham, which they meant to run as a shop for the
      sale of Indian tea and West Indian coffee&mdash;the &ldquo;Old Flag&rdquo; was their
      trade-mark&mdash;and a brisk sale of half-pound and quarter-pound packets
      was going on at the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much the ladies who had just entered could see; but a moment after they
      had taken their first illuminating glance round the place they stood with
      their eyes fixed upon one of the most prominent objects of the place&mdash;the
      bustling figure of the Cachar of Darjeeling in native dress, turban and
      jewels and all, tying up parcels of tea behind the counter, and testing
      the coins which the crowd of customers tendered in payment before pulling
      the bell-ringing drawer of the cash register!
    </p>
    <p>
      The enterprise of Messrs. Caterham had suggested to them the advertising
      attraction in the form of a full-robed Oriental at the head of their new
      tea department. They had promoted one of their old hands&mdash;he came
      from the East End of London&mdash;to the post, and having &ldquo;made up&rdquo; under
      the guidance of one of Messrs. Nathan's most highly qualified assistants,
      Messrs. Caterham were perhaps not going too far when they asserted in
      their advertisements that the tea trade of Burford would assume an
      entirely new complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies gazed in horrible fascination upon the impostor&mdash;at the
      moment they were unable to differentiate between an advertisement and an
      impostor&mdash;for nearly a whole minute, and then they turned and walked
      slowly away without exchanging a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Paston left Burford the next day, having been ordered by her medical
      adviser to Buxton. But Major Sowerby picked out his most serviceable
      Malacca cane, and was heard to declare, while trying its balance in
      downward strokes from left to right, that he had only to come across that
      scoundrel who called himself by the honourable title of a loyal Indian
      potentate in order to teach him a lesson that he would remember so long as
      he had breath in his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general impression that prevailed throughout Burford, however, so soon
      as the story of the exclusive ladies and their Indian prince was in full
      circulation&mdash;and it did not take long to pass round the town&mdash;was
      that the incident should teach a lesson to a good many people who take it
      upon them to lead the red-tiled society of the new town.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whether they learn any lesson or not, there seems to be a consensus of
      opinion that the sooner the name of the High Street is changed to Prince's
      Parade the better it will be for the town, Messrs. Caterham, and,
      incidentally, Mr. Isaac Moss, professionally known as the Cachar of
      Darjeeling. (As a matter of fact, there are already several people not
      belonging to the governing classes who, ever since the episode just
      recorded, have invariably alluded to the lower part of the High Street&mdash;that
      part which has been annexed by Messrs. Caterham&mdash;as the Prince's
      Parade.)

      WHAT ADROITNESS several years ago a distinguished dramatist explained to a
      pressing interviewer what was his intention in writing a certain play of
      his which was being widely discussed in many directions. It was merely to
      show how dangerous it was for any man to wander off the beaten track, he
      said: &ldquo;A man must keep in line with his fellow-men if he hopes to avoid

      satisfactory by such persons as had been perturbed on the matter to which
      it referred.

    <p>
      It certainly would have been accepted with every token of assent by the

      The stanza embodies their highest aspirations; and really, when one comes
      to consider the whole matter, one could hardly formulate a more
      satisfactory walk of life; only it is a walk, not a race, and some people
      (outside a country town) look to go through life at a faster pace. &ldquo;In the
      way our fathers trod&rdquo;&mdash;that is the sound motto of the country town,
      and the man who tries to get out of the old ruts is looked upon with
      suspicion by the sensible people to whom he may allude as old rutters or
      even old rotters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged inhabitant of a town nearly twice as large as our Mallingham
      was greatly impressed with this truth by an incident which had just come
      under his notice when I had occasion to call upon him some time ago. He
      told me that he had been visited by a former townsman of his, but one whom
      he had not seen for more than fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you wouldn't remember Joseph Starkie, old Sol Starkie's son,&rdquo; he said
      to me in the course of his narrative. &ldquo;It was before you came to county.
      Queer restless chap was Joe always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he any relation to the Starkie who invented the magnetic lathe that is
      used everywhere in the States?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't wonder,&rdquo; he replied, as if making a sad admission. &ldquo;Yes, I
      believe he said something about it when he was with me. He was just that
      sort of chap&mdash;so restless and dissatisfied always&mdash;wanting to do
      things differently from how they had always been done. His father was a
      most respectable man, however, in the hardware line, and Joe was too much
      for him: he packed him off to an uncle in the States, and there he has
      been ever since, he told me. &ldquo;Sad&mdash;very sad! His father had quite a
      nice little business here, and if Joe had only settled down reasonably he
      might have succeeded to it and done well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that he has done pretty well elsewhere,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;His name
      is well known in every machine shop in the States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? Well, maybe so; but that's not like having a comfortable
      place at home. Why, he might even have had a seat at the Town Council or
      the Water Board in time. When he came in here to-day I knew him at once;
      but I wasn't too eager with him until I saw from his way that he hadn't
      come to borrow money, as I feared at first. He wanted to inquire about
      some of his old associates, and he knew that I could tell him. 'Where's
      Johnnie Vance?' he asked. 'I looked in at his old office just now and no
      one seemed disposed to tell me.' I shook my head and pointed up the road.
      He saw what I meant. 'Jail?' he whispered. 'Jail? What was the trouble?'
      'Embezzlement,' I told him. 'Well, well, who would have thought it?' he
      said. 'And maybe you can tell me if Willie Rossiter is still in his old
      crib,' he asked. I shook my head. 'Don't tell me that he's in jail too,'
      he cried. 'No, no&mdash;at least, not exactly. I want to be fair to every
      one. It's not jail, only the asylum.' 'What!' he said. 'Willie Rossiter&mdash;the
      asylum? How did it come about&mdash;an accident?' It went against my grain
      to tell him that it was drink, but he pressed me and I had to do it; and
      then he went on to talk about the old town for some time, but I could see
      that he had another friend to ask about. He pretended to be at the point
      of going and then suddenly to remember that there was somebody else. Jimmy
      Gray&mdash;it was Jimmy Gray. 'By the bye,' he said, 'I wonder if old
      Jimmy Gray is still knocking about.' I smiled. 'No, he's not doing much
      knocking about just now,' I told him. 'Not dead?' he asked. 'Oh no,' said
      I; 'only he has just taken rooms in the Bridgend Hotel.' 'What! the
      workhouse?' he cried. 'The workhouse indeed,' said I. 'And nobody would
      have known anything about it if he hadn't made a fool of himself writing
      to the Board of Guardians complaining that he had been kept waiting for a
      quarter of an hour when he had applied for admission.' That was the last
      of his inquiries after his old friends. But they had all been restless
      chaps like himself&mdash;not settling down to anything properly. Still, he
      didn't ask me to lend him any money, and that was something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely fail to see that this exemplary citizen felt keenly the
      value of the dramatist's suggestion, that it is very dangerous for a man
      to fall out of line with the rest of the community. Social laws exist for
      the community, not for the individual. At the same time, I was not so
      firmly convinced as my friend seemed to be that Mr. Starkie's career could
      be pointed to as a notable instance of the peril of marching out of the
      way our fathers trod. He had declined to yield to the influences of the
      magnet that &ldquo;hung in the hardware shop&rdquo; of his father, and had so forsaken
      the two hundred a year and the obscurity of his native town for the
      million dollars which he had earned by his inventions in Pennsylvania, to
      say nothing of the fame which accrues to an inventor who knows how to put
      his inventions on the market; so that there might really be some people
      ready to assert that Joe Starkie's restlessness suggested that a
      divergence from the scheme of the Red-man on the warpath, who is careful
      to step into the footprints of the man who goes before him, may now and
      again be advisable. I did not say so to my exemplary citizen, however; for
      the fame of Joe Starkie had not yet reached the place of his nativity, and
      the exemplary citizen might have asked me what about Joe Starkie's old
      friends who were now sojourning in various public institutions, and he
      would not have been satisfied with my replying to the effect that they had
      stayed at home, and were suffering for it.

      fathers trod&rdquo;&mdash;that seems to be the proud boast of the English
      country towns, and I am not sure that it is not a worthy one, though its
      application to certain cases is certainly humorous. I remember revisiting
      a town where I had once lived, and getting into conversation with an
      elderly and well-to-do inhabitant. I mentioned having met in London a
      surgeon who had been born in and lived in the town. He certainly enjoyed
      the largest practice in London, and, in addition to the K.C.B., bore as
      many continental orders as permitted of his wearing (which he did) a very
      dingy dress-coat without its dinginess being perceptible. His reputation
      had, however, eluded the cognizance of his native town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool he was to go off to London, when he might have done so well
      here,&rdquo; was the comment of the elderly citizen upon my proud boast that I
      had met Sir William in London. &ldquo;If he had only held on here he might by
      this time have got the best dispensary in the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the same view in regard to the career of another eminent townsman,
      who, I mentioned, had just been made an F.R.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had been wise and carried on his father's business here he might
      have been a J.P. by now,&rdquo; was his solemn comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it better to refrain from any further remarks, lest I should be
      made to feel more acutely than I did all that I had forfeited by my
      premature departure from a town that offered such prizes for obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still a large number of country towns in England where the
      feeling still remains that any departure from their precincts is, if not
      absolutely fatal, at any rate risky. I have met people in more than one
      town who looked on a man's going to America as equivalent to absconding. I
      suppose most of these places have some foundation of their own for the
      tradition. It is quite plausible that, seventy or eighty or even a hundred
      years ago, some wild young men may have found a voyage to America to offer
      them a satisfactory alternative to an appearance behind the spikes of the
      dock of the County Court-House, and America got a bad name in consequence,
      being looked on as a continent peopled by men who had gone wrong at home.
      However this may be, I must confess that I was startled, when I first came
      to Thurswell and mentioned that I heard that a young man who had played a
      good deal of lawn-tennis during the summer was going to the States, by the
      inquiry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has he been doing anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not come from one of the rustic population, but from a tradesman in
      quite a good way of business&mdash;a considerable proportion of it in
      canned provisions into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that when Dr. Watson, the author of <i>Beside the Bonnie Brier
      Bush</i>, went on his first lecturing tour to America, the financial
      results of which were so satisfactory, an impression prevailed in certain
      directions that the act was unworthy of a clergyman of the Presbyterian
      Church, and he was made the object of a severe attack in some quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can easily appreciate the attitude of people who have lived all their
      lives in an English country town in regard to the restless members of a
      family. One has only to walk through a churchyard and read the names on
      the tombs to understand how deeply rooted in the soil are the people. So
      far as Thurs-well and Mallingham are concerned, a stroll through one of
      the churchyards is almost equivalent to studying a directory. The same
      names as are cut upon the tombs&mdash;some of them going back a hundred
      and fifty years&mdash;are to be seen over the shop windows to-day and on
      the dairy carts and the farm carts. In some cases the name of a yeoman
      ancestor reappears in a Grand Jury list, indicating a material advance in
      the social scale. The migration that has been going on in our county for
      the past two hundred years seems to be interparochial. Individuals moved
      from village to village and from village to town. It is only within the
      past twenty-five or thirty years that the ablest and the best have
      occasionally braved public opinion and set sail for a colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even families that have &ldquo;got on&rdquo; seem to love to cling to the county which
      saw the very small beginnings of their ancestors. Why should they not?
      Love of one's county is only a subdivision of the grand virtue of love of
      one's country. It was only when a certain aged doctor, who had the family
      history of our neighbourhood at his fingers' ends for over sixty years,
      published a volume of interesting reminiscences, in the course of which he
      took occasion to refer to the very humble beginnings of some families that
      considered themselves very &ldquo;swagger,&rdquo; that we learned how tenaciously they
      had clung to their county. Even the slow-moving Mallingham is not without
      its romances of &ldquo;getting on.&rdquo; One of the most intrepid motorists in the
      borough is remembered by several middle-aged burgesses as the wearer of
      the green baize apron and the wielder of the broom of the caretaker and
      window-cleaner of a solicitor's office; and from what I know of him I am
      inclined to believe that that was the best kept office in the town when he
      had charge of it.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;IN THE SHADOW OF THE MINSTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ROADMINSTER IS ONE
      OF THE LESSER cathedral towns of England. There is nothing remarkable
      about the Minster except its antiquity. It does not convey the idea of
      vastness as do some of these venerable buildings. One would never imagine
      oneself in the midst of a petrified forest on passing through the porch.
      The carving about the pillars does not suggest lacework in stone, though
      it is admirable in its way, and the screen shows signs of having been
      &ldquo;restored&rdquo; in the days when restoration meant spoliation. The coloured
      glass of the windows is not especially good, but the oldest is undoubtedly
      the best. The modern memorial windows were apparently estimated for and
      the specification of the lowest-priced competitor accepted; but, really,
      the Chapter should have prevented the perpetration of such a blunder as
      that of the artist who, in his representation of the entrance to the
      sacred tomb, with the sleeping Roman guards on each side, put a crescent
      moon in the very blue sky! But for that matter, when I pointed out the
      mistake to one of the higher canons, he did not perceive for some time
      that the Paschal moon was bound to be within a few days of the full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Minster is, however, worthy of every respect, if it does not quite
      inspire such feelings of reverence and awe as does Westminster Abbey or
      Canterbury or Durham or Santa Croce at Florence. One feels that it is the
      sort of building one can trust. It is solid throughout, and that is
      something. I remember years ago, when I was lecturing a long-suffering
      group on the marvels of Milan, calling attention to the wonderful scheme
      of lighting by which the High Altar was made the centre of illumination, I
      observed some shadows of the stone spandrels on the roof for which I could
      not account. There the light spines and ridges flowed upward to meet at
      the apex, and there the shadows slept, increasing the effect amazingly.
      Only after some patient investigation did I find that the groins were
      painted on the woodwork to imitate the stone where the stonework ended!
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is nothing to wonder at in the interior of Broadminster, there is
      at least something to trust. It is sound throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, oh! why, should that old woman be allowed to stand just outside
      the porch with a basket of nuts on her arm, offering them for sale to all
      visitors?
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger within our gates was puzzled by this apparition at the door of
      the church. He had just come from London, and he had been taken to the
      Zoo. He looked for some reason for the nuts at Broadminster&mdash;reason
      and consistency. If nuts, why not buns, he wished me to explain to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt incapable of clearing away this mystery. I could not tell him,
      under the shadow of the sacred building, the legend that I invented to
      account for the nuts, but I told him in full when we got away from that
      influence of veracity: it had to do with a crusader who, forsaken by his
      comrades in the Lebanon, was forced to sustain himself with nuts, and
      vowed that if ever he should get back to England he would endow a Minster
      and decree that nuts should be offered at the porch between prime and
      angelus every day for a thousand years. He kept his vow, hence&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was eight hundred and eighty-two years ago, so that only one hundred
      and twenty of the vow had yet to run, and then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was barely satisfied with this explanation. I could scarcely blame him:
      it did not satisfy myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some people who think that the best part of St. Ursula&mdash;the
      Minster is dedicated to St. Ursula&mdash;is the Close. The Deanery, and
      the residences of the canons, major and minor, and all the officials of
      the Cathedral, lay as well as clerical, stand on two sides of a square,
      with the old building in the centre. Green meadows with a glimpse of green
      hills beyond are on the other sides of the square, and just behind the
      houses of the Close flows the Avonbeck, a narrow winding river in which
      trout may be caught by the dozen by the least skilful fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful gardens of the Close slope down to the banks of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was told a pathetic story by the wife of one of the dignitaries
      respecting a young man who had never any especial leaning for the Church
      as a career, but who made up his mind, when he saw this Close and walked
      through the gardens and fished in the Avonbeck, that the Church was the
      only possible profession for him. He went through the usual course, was
      ordained, and appointed to a parish in a slum in the Midlands, where he
      has remained ever since&mdash;and that was twenty-five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally pathetic, however, to some people may be the case of the clergyman
      who practically started life as one of the lesser dignitaries of the
      Cathedral and has remained there ever since&mdash;and that was thirty-five
      years ago. It was said that he was once a good preacher, and even now he
      seldom falls more than a couple of tones in going from the Responses to
      the Prayers. He began with high ideas regarding Greek texts, but now he
      devotes himself to Canadian trout. He has great hopes, he told me, for the
      future of Canadian trout.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE NEW PALACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Palace of the
      Bishop of Broadminster is not, of course, among the buildings of the
      Close. It stands in its own grounds about two miles away, and it bears
      tokens of having been built within the last quarter of a century. It did
      not start life as a palace, but as the country house of a business man in
      a bustling town. The story of how it became the Palace is a curious one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Palace was a big square barrack of a place, costing a great
      deal to keep up and giving no adequate return for its upkeep. It was a
      survival of the days when a bishop was expected to maintain a retinue of
      servants and never to go out for a quiet drive unless four horses were
      harnessed to the coach. The stables were built to accommodate twenty-two
      horses: it seemed to be understood that no self-respecting bishop could do
      with less, so long-lived are the Church traditions of the Middle Ages; and
      the servant retinue was expected to be maintained in the same proportion.
      The consequence was that the revenues of the diocese were quite
      insufficient to do more than keep up the place; they left nothing over for
      the poor Bishop himself, who could do very well with a 15 h.p. motor and a
      garage 25' x 15', a single chauffeur, and a gardener, instead of six
      horses, a coachman, an under-coachman, four grooms, and nine gardeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and again the question of the requirements of the Palace as
      opposed to the requirements of the Bishop was cropping up, and certain
      newspapers published letters from ignorant and irresponsible
      correspondents in which the phrases &ldquo;bloated revenues,&rdquo; &ldquo;princely
      prelates,&rdquo; &ldquo;modern Wolseys,&rdquo; and the like recurred, particular emphasis
      being laid upon the fact that his lordship kept no fewer than eleven
      gardeners&mdash;a very moderate exaggeration&mdash;for his own personal
      gratification as a horticulturist. And all this was very harassing for the
      poor Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the years when the upkeep of both the Bishop and the Palace was
      becoming a serious problem, there was living in a bustling manufacturing
      town a hundred miles from Broadminster a quiet little business man named
      Robinson. He had begun life in a rather small way; but before he was
      forty, having no expensive tastes and being engaged in a lucrative
      business, he had made a fortune&mdash;not, of course, such a fortune as
      may be made in the United States in these days, but still a fortune for an
      English provincial town. It so happened that he lodged with two maiden
      sisters slightly older than himself, and when he was about fifty he asked
      the elder to marry him. She agreed, and married they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      After living a year or two in the house in which he had lodged they
      started a one-horse brougham, and a little later Mrs. Robinson had a fancy
      to live in the country; and as her husband invariably thought as she did
      on every subject, he at once set about building a house that would always
      be worth (his architect assured him) the money he spent upon it. Mrs.
      Robinson being a pious woman and liking the Cathedral service, the site of
      the house should be, they determined, within easy reach of Broadminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an admirable house when it was finished, and the three-acre garden
      could easily be managed by one man and a boy. This was in the days when a
      financial episode, known as the brewery boom, was beginning to be felt
      throughout the country, and it was known that Mr. Robinson had made as
      much in a week out of brewery shares as paid for the house he had built
      and the gardens that had been laid out for him by a competent landscape
      architect. And on the first morning that he breakfasted in their new home
      he presented his wife with the title-deeds of the whole, and made over the
      furniture to her as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five years they lived there in great happiness, and it was known that
      they were devoted to each other; but before they entered on their sixth
      year Mrs. Robinson died, and her husband found that she had made a will
      leaving the house and grounds and furniture to the Church authorities&mdash;whoever
      they were&mdash;for the use of the existing Bishop of Broadminster and his
      successors for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Mrs. Robinson had become aware of the Palace difficulty,
      and made up her mind that she should do her best to solve the question of
      providing a reasonable residence for the Bishop in place of that
      insatiable monstrous barrack which he had been compelled to occupy, and
      upon which he was forced to spend every penny of his income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the will rather startled Mr. Robinson&mdash;for his wife had not
      confided in him that it was her intention to provide for the Bishop and
      his successors&mdash;he had no fault to find with it. He confessed to a
      friend that his dear wife had solved a question that might have perplexed
      himself; for he had no relative to whom he might reasonably be expected to
      leave the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before many days had passed he received a message from the
      ecclesiastical solicitors begging him to have the goodness to let them
      know at his convenience when it would suit him to give their clients
      possession of the house: and then he was really startled. A visit to his
      own solicitor made him aware of the fact that no provision had been made
      in his wife's will for allowing him to continue residing in the house or
      using the furniture therein&mdash;that he was, in fact, a trespasser in
      the house that he had built for himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      A little thought, however, convinced him that as soon as the facts of the
      case became known to the Church authorities there would be no trouble in
      obtaining their consent to his remaining on in the house; but it soon
      appeared that he had been rather too sanguine on this point. It was
      explained to him that the authorities were unfortunately left without any
      option in the matter, and possession of the place must be given to them
      within three months, rent for this period to be paid by him at a rate that
      might be agreed between his solicitor and themselves. They were
      ecclesiastically courteous, but legally firm, and so Mr. Robinson had to
      leave the house on which he had spent many hours of loving and intelligent
      thought the gardens to which he had given particular attention while they
      were being laid out, and the furniture which he had selected piece by
      piece from the best makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was allowed to take away his own clothes, however, and he began to feel
      that this was a concession.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Lausanne and died there a few years later, leaving about a
      hundred thousand pounds to various charities, but none of them having any
      connection with Broadminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the year in which the property was acquired by the
      Church it became the Palace, Broadminster: previously it had been called
      Leighside Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that day it is understood that the Bishop has been saving money
      to make up for the years which the early locust abode of his had eaten.

      III.&mdash;ANTE-MORTEM GENEROSITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>uriously enough,
      there stands within view of the new Palace another house with a history
      attached to it which may strike some people as illustrating, with a humour
      that is still more grim, the inconvenience resulting from ante-mortem
      generosity on a large scale: post-mortem generosity may occasionally be
      risky, but its display on even the most lavish scale has never been known
      to cause any personal inconvenience to the one who indulges in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is an interesting old Jacobean one, standing on the side of a
      mound within a loop of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has consequently a series of terrace gardens which are quite delightful
      at all seasons. For years it was occupied by a Captain Hesketh and his
      wife, the latter having inherited it with a handsome fortune from her
      mother, who was the heiress of a family of considerable importance in the
      county. At her husband's death Mrs. Hesketh continued to live alone in the
      old house with a niece&mdash;for she had no children of her own&mdash;and
      in course of time the girl fell in love with a man who seemed in every way
      the right sort of person for her to marry, only for the fact of his having
      a very limited income. The girl's aunt, however, having nothing to live
      for except the witnessing of the happiness of the young couple, was
      generous enough to make over to them all her property, retaining only a
      sufficient sum to enable her to live in comfort for the remainder of her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time she was sixty-three years of age, and her wants were very
      simple. It is said that the annuity which she purchased amounted to no
      more than three hundred pounds a year. Twelve years later, however, the
      lawyer whom she had entrusted to carry out this portion of the transaction
      for her died, and an examination of his affairs revealed the fact that,
      instead of spending the money which she had handed to him in the purchase
      of an annuity guaranteed by an Insurance Company of good reputation, he
      had treated it as his own, and had merely paid her a quarterly allowance.
      He died a bankrupt, owing thousands of pounds to clients whose money he
      had appropriated; so that at the age of seventy-five the unfortunate lady
      found herself penniless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her position was annoying, she told the man from whom I had the story, but
      she did not feel it to be serious. Of course, she had only to explain
      matters to her niece and her niece's husband and they would take care that
      she should not suffer through the swindling agent. She hastened to have an
      interview with them on the subject, and was actually smiling as she told
      them what had happened. She was not smiling, however, when the interview
      terminated; for she found herself treated by them as a begging stranger.
      They gave her a sound scolding for her unbusinesslike credulity: the idea
      of entrusting her money to such a man without taking the trouble to find
      out how he had invested it! The thing was absurd&mdash;grossly absurd, and
      they thought that she deserved to suffer for her culpable carelessness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, though surprised and hurt at this want of sympathy, the old
      lady readily admitted that she had been very careless; but the man had
      been her lawyer and her husband's lawyer for over thirty years, and she
      had implicit confidence in him, she said. After all, she reminded her
      relations that she was an old woman, and that in all probability she would
      not be a burden to them for more than a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plea did not seem to soften them in any way; at any rate, it did not
      prevent her niece from expressing the opinion that it was most
      inconsiderate on her part to expect that she and her husband should accept
      the responsibility of keeping her for the rest of her life. They had two
      children to educate, she explained, and it was going too far to expect
      that they should be made to suffer because of her stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old lady felt herself turned out of her old house&mdash;the house
      in which she might still have been living if she had not been so foolishly
      generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, however, she received a letter from her niece's husband
      informing her that, after due consideration of the matter, he and his wife
      had come to the conclusion that, although she had no claim whatsoever upon
      them, they might be able to allow her a pound a week for life. He trusted
      that she had saved enough during the previous twelve years to allow of her
      living comfortably&mdash;many women, he reminded her, were compelled to
      live on much less. The final sentence in his letter was equivalent to an
      exhortation to her to thank Heaven for having given her a niece of so
      generous a disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story reached the ears of a lady who had been her friend for many
      years, and she insisted on her rejecting the alms of her niece, offering
      her a home with herself, and expressing her happiness to receive her under
      her roof. The old lady accepted her friend's invitation; but at the same
      time she made application to be admitted as an inmate to a certain
      almshouse which had been founded and endowed by one of her own ancestors.
      This step, however, she took in secret, and at least a year would have to
      elapse before she could hope for admission to the charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that her generous friend had a son who had
      obtained some eminence at the Bar, and it seemed that the grim humour of
      the whole story appealed to him very strongly. But on thinking over the
      matter he perceived that this element in the story was not so finished as
      he thought it should be, if properly worked out by an ironic fate. He
      considered himself to be something of a critic in such matters, and it was
      possibly his artistic instinct that prompted him to make a move with a
      view to remedy the deficiency that he perceived in the story. He had
      acquired a pretty fair knowledge of men and their characteristics, and it
      occurred to him that a solicitor who gave up so much of his attention to
      the movements of stocks and shares as did this dishonest one who was the
      cause of the old lady's disaster, might possibly have been guilty of some
      neglect in respect of the deeds of gift conveying her property to her
      niece, and he turned his attention in this direction. He knew exactly what
      legal machinery to put in motion for the purpose of his inquiry, and the
      result he considered highly satisfactory; but it is doubtful if the
      ungrateful niece of the poor lady for whom the solicitor he had engaged
      was acting was of the same opinion when she received notice that a motion
      was about to be made before His Majesty's judges to set aside the deed of
      gift made twelve years earlier on account of a vital flaw in the document
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ungrateful niece and her husband consulted their solicitor when they
      received their shock. He laughed reassuringly at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds very like a bit of bluff,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What does it mean? Why should
      your aunt want to get into her hands again the property that she made over
      to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man told him that the lady had been the victim of a rascally
      solicitor, and so was left without a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now she seems to have got into the hands of another of the same
      stamp, only worse,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;I don't think you need be uneasy.
      I'll get a copy of the original deed and get counsel's opinion about it.
      Trent will be the man. I'll send it to Trent. He is the leading man for
      that sort of thing. If there's any flaw in it he'll be able to lay his
      finger on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two clients looked at each other with something like dismay on their
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt has been living for the past three months with a Mrs. Trent, I
      have heard,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer opened his eyes unusually wide and screwed up his mouth into
      the form of a puckered O.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is his mother,&rdquo; he said after a pause. &ldquo;But why&mdash;why should he
      bother about such a piece of business as this? Why should he be interested
      in upsetting the deed when it was obviously the intention of your aunt to
      present you with the property? You have not quarrelled with her, have
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, there was no quarrel. She came to us with her story, of course,
      and we at once offered to do something for her,&rdquo; replied the niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That was the sensible thing to do. But this only makes the
      matter seem more mysterious. She accepted your offer, I suppose, and why,
      then, she should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did she make a demand on you to return the whole property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. But she suggested that we should make good the three hundred a
      year of her annuity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't that what you say you promised her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We told her we couldn't afford that; but we offered her fifty-two pounds
      a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pound a week&mdash;one pound a week? Oh, my dear lady! A pound a week!
      Surely you are joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought that she must surely have saved a good deal during the twelve
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred a year, when you deduct the in-come tax, doesn't leave a
      gentlewoman much margin for saving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man of the law shook his head and assumed a very serious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I can't say anything at this moment as to the sort of case
      they have against you; but I do not feel justified in concealing from you
      my impression that if it is as we suppose, and Mr. Trent has pronounced
      against the deed, the Court will take his view of it. Trent is not the man
      to try on any sharp practice. And my advice to you is to make any
      sacrifice to prevent the case from going before the Court. Trent, if he is
      moving in the matter, must feel the ground pretty firm under his feet.
      What a pity it was that you did not suggest three hundred a year to the
      lady instead of&mdash;oh, that was undoubtedly a mistake&mdash;a pound a
      week. Well, we can only do our best in the circumstances. Who are the
      solicitors that sent you the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady gave him the name of the firm, and in due course he communicated
      with them. An examination of the doubtful document removed the possibility
      of his retaining any doubt as to its being invalid, and his clients were
      assured that they could not contend the case there was against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, I suppose, there was a scene that could only have justice done
      to its varied features by the pen of a gifted novelist. I can see the
      weeping niece on her knees in front of the old lady who had been her
      benefactrix, but whom she had repaid with gross ingratitude. Her children
      would possibly be kneeling by her side&mdash;they certainly would on the
      lyric stage or in the last chapter of the novel. No doubt the aunt would
      be greatly affected, though properly reproachful. But I doubt if the
      gallery of the theatre or the readers of the novelette would be quite
      satisfied with the conclusion of the story; for the generous aunt allowed
      her original gift to stand, only stipulating for her three hundred a year
      out of the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever humour one may perceive in these stories is certainly of that
      unusual type which one might expect to find associated with a cathedral
      town. It is the humour of an Old Testament parable&mdash;hard, and with a
      lesson attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not precisely of the same nature was the definition of the duties of the
      verger suggested by a promising youth, whom I had instructions to lead
      round the Minster by his relations: they intended him to become an
      architect, and thought that he should become acquainted with the design of
      all the cathedrals to begin with. At first he supposed that the dignified
      gentleman wearing the black gown and carrying a mysterious emblem of
      authority was an archbishop, and I fear I failed to place him in
      possession of the facts respecting the duties of the verger, for he
      nodded, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Ah yes, I understand&mdash;a sort of dignified
      chuck-er-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not on record that there was attached to any great ecclesiastical
      institution a dignitary who discharged the duties of a calcitrator. And,
      so far as Broadminster is concerned, one may say that, whatever brawls
      disturb the peace of other churches upon occasions, tranquillity reigns
      within these grey walls and harmony among the spirits of its fortunate
      aisles.

      IV.&mdash;THE BLACK SHEEP
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nly the merest
      echo of a rumour of years ago regarding a parson who managed to creep into
      the Chapter when he should have been excluded survives to-day. And even
      this attenuated scandal would have faded away long ago if some people had
      not kept it alive by a story which owes its point to the use made of the
      shady parson's name by an old reprobate who desired to score off a worthy
      clergyman. The worthy clergyman had come to pay a serious parochial visit
      of remonstrance to the old reprobate, and had made up his mind, in antique
      slang, to &ldquo;let him have it hot.&rdquo; He had tried the velvet glove of the
      kindly counsellor several times with the same man, and now he determined
      to see what the mailed fist would do. Chronic intoxication was the old
      reprobate's besetting sin, and that was&mdash;with more frequent intervals
      of repentance&mdash;the particular failing of that parson who had been a
      thorn in the flesh to the Cathedral Chapter. It was, however, the vice of
      which the visiting clergyman was most intolerant; so he launched out in
      fitting terms against the old reprobate, demonstrating to him how
      disgraceful, how senseless a thing it was to be a sot.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0211.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The man listened to him until the first pause came, and then he sighed,
      saying&mdash;&ldquo;Truer words were never spoken, sir, and no one knows that
      better than yourself, Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Weston was the name of the frail parson, who had been dead for several
      years, and to hear himself so addressed was very nettling to the teetotal
      clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is not Weston,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;You know that I am Mr.
      Walters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;But I hold with all you say, and
      no one has ever said the same better than yourself, Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call me Weston,&rdquo; cried the clergyman. &ldquo;The fact that you are
      muddled on a simple matter like this shows clearly to what condition you
      have sunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't doubt it, sir,&rdquo; acquiesced the man sadly. &ldquo;It's not a condition
      for any human to be, though mayhap it's worse when it overtakes a passon,
      as I'm sure you'll hold with me, Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was informed that you had been sober for some days,&rdquo; said the
      clergyman. &ldquo;But I now begin to fear that you are far from being anything
      like sober. Have you had anything to drink to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a drop&mdash;not a drop, I'm sorry to confess to you, Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good parson sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wretched man!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are clearly so bemuddled with
      that poison that you are incapable of recognising who is speaking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, sir; I'm not so far gone as that. I'm never so far gone but
      that I can know when a passon's a-speaking to me, Mr. Weston. I s'pose
      'tis summit in their manner o' speech, Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tortured clergyman caught up his hat and rushed from the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few people would have given the old reprobate credit for striking upon so
      subtle a scheme of retaliation upon the clergyman who was a model of
      rectitude, had not the clergyman himself been indiscreet enough to
      complain, as he did with great bitterness, that the horrid old man was so
      fuddled with drink as to be incapable of differentiating between a cleric
      who had never been in the shadow of a cloud and one who had never been
      otherwise than shady, and who, moreover, had been among the shades for
      several years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, however, some people who had had experience of the readiness
      of resources of the old reprobate, and who knew how he had aimed at
      getting even with his upright visitor. And so the story spread, and was
      the means of keeping green, if one may be allowed the metaphor, the
      unsavoury memory of the thorn in the flesh of the Chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the wicked old man only simulated for his own base purposes a
      mistake as to the identity of Mr. Walters, there was certainly no such
      evil intention on the part of a young woman who, when on a visit to a
      relation living in Broadminster, was invited to a dinner party and was
      taken in by a fine-looking man of military appearance whose name was
      pronounced by their hostess as Colonel Trelawney. The lady rather prided
      herself on being equal to converse with men of any profession, and she at
      once started with her partner at the table on a military topic, and
      continued to ply him with questions of a more or less technical sort, on
      most of which he professed an ignorance surprising in one who had attained
      to the rank of a commanding officer. She almost became cross with the
      completeness of her failure to draw him out; but just as the cheese straws
      were going round she asked him in desperation if there was any branch of
      the Service in which he was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course I am interested in every part of it, but just
      now I have been studying all the authorities on the order of the Creeds,
      and I must confess that I find them enthralling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in the Sappers?&rdquo; she asked after a long pause. She had heard that
      some of the Sappers had peculiarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sappers?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The Sappers? I'm afraid I don't quite
      understand your question. How could I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not Colonel Trelawney?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Canon Trelawney,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What! Is it possible that you fancied&mdash;oh,
      it must be so. That is why you have been talking on military topics all
      this time. Colonel! Oh, this is really amusing! Colonel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that our hostess had said 'Colonel,'&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You must
      have fancied that I was mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was largely my own fault,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am a little old-fashioned, and
      I have never taken kindly to the modern innovation in evening dress
      adopted by my brethren. My father was a parson and he habitually wore
      ordinary evening dress, and I followed him in this particular. I think I
      shall have to get a dog collar and satin stock after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady did not care whether he did or not. She felt she had wasted an
      evening.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;TROLLOPE'S MRS. PROUDIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O ONE WHO HAS
      LIVED FOR ANY length of time in a cathedral town can fail to appreciate
      the perfection of Anthony Trollope's Barchester series of novels. In my
      opinion no more artistic achievement than the creation of Barchester and
      its people exists on the same scale in the English language. I do not
      think that there is a false note in any scene&mdash;a crude tone in any
      character. Certainly no writer ever dealt with the members of any
      profession with such completeness and without ceasing to interest a reader
      from page to page, from chapter to chapter, from volume to volume. Fancy
      any writer venturing upon five long novels with all the chief characters
      solicitors or solicitors' wives and daughters! Fancy a dozen medical men
      stethoscoping their way through a thousand closely printed pages! We know
      what military novels we have been treated to from time to time&mdash;stuff
      to send guffaws round every mess-room&mdash;as crude as the red of the
      tunics that gave the marksmen of other armies every chance in the old
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personages in <i>Barchester Towers, The Warden, and The Last Chronicle
      of Barset</i> are such finished pieces of characterisation that they
      strike one as being photographs from life. One feels that the author must
      have had intimate acquaintance with the originals of his portraits, as
      well as with their entourage, before he could produce such transcripts
      from nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose there was a good deal of speculation when the Barchester novels
      were appearing as to the identity of the various cathedral dignitaries. It
      seems to me that such a &ldquo;placing&rdquo; of the people was inevitable. But an
      example was given me of the artistic way in which Trollope went to work in
      the case of one of his best remembered characters that let me see what a
      master of his art he was. I was some years under twenty when <i>The Last
      Chronicle</i> fell into my hands: it was the first novel of Trollope's
      that I read, so that was the first acquaintance I had with Mrs. Proudie.
      Before I had got through many chapters I knew that I was listening to the
      voice of the wife of an Irish Prelate&mdash;a lady whose character and
      temperament had been a twenty years' tradition in the household of which I
      was a member, and whose reputation had followed her from one city to
      another. The more I read of the book the more impressed I was that this
      lady had been the model for Mrs. Proudie in spite of the fact that the two
      had practically nothing in common&mdash;nothing except the essentials that
      go to make up a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Proudie was a plain, rather stout little woman, but my Mrs. Proudie
      was a tall, slight, and undoubtedly beautiful woman, even when middle-aged&mdash;the
      most perfect type of the traditional aristocrat. It would have been
      impossible for her to do any of the pettifogging of Trollope's vulgar
      person, in the way that Mrs. Proudie did it, but it was quite clearly
      understood&mdash;by no one better than the Bishop himself&mdash;that she
      was the ruler of the diocese. She was the mother of a family every member
      of which was remarkably good-looking; but Trollope laid emphasis upon the
      commonplace daughters of the Proudies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only an artist of the highest rank could create a character such as Mrs.
      Proudie from the suggestions he had derived from the rumours respecting
      our Bishop's wife, and only an artist of the highest rank could create a
      personage which compelled all readers who knew the original to recognise
      the source of his inspiration and feel certain of its identity in spite of
      the absence of all outward marks of identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years after reading the Barchester series I was accustomed to
      hear people in the neighbourhood in which I lived refer to the Bishop's
      wife as Mrs. Proudie&mdash;several clergymen certainly did so; but quite
      fifteen years had passed before I heard that, previous to his writing <i>Barchester
      Towers</i>, the author had been stationed in the same neighbourhood as an
      Inspector in the Post Office Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; said my informant, who had served under Trollope, &ldquo;the
      Bishop's wife was at the height of her fame. Every one was talking about
      her and the way she kept the poor Bishop under her thumb. We expected that
      Mr. Trollope would make something out of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I asked him how he could reconcile the difference between Mrs.
      Proudie and the other lady&mdash;how he could reconcile Mrs. Proudie's
      death in <i>The Last Chronicle</i> with the other's still active life, he
      told me that he had never read any of Trollope's books: the only writings
      of Trollope that had come under his cognizance were the official reports
      which he made to the head of the Department!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful to the last, and ruling to the last, <i>our</i> Mrs. Proudie
      survived the published record of the other Mrs. Proudie by nearly thirty
      years. I write this chapter sitting on a sofa which I bought out of the
      Palace. The fact that the receipt of my cheque was signed by the Bishop
      and not by the lady, suggests that in financial matters his lordship was
      permitted to discharge the humblest of clerical duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Broadminster there has never been a rumour of a Mrs. Proudie; but
      occasionally there comes a discordant note from the belfry of the
      Cathedral. Only a quick ear can detect it, but having detected it, one is
      conscious of an impression of uneasiness, and asks oneself or anybody else
      if it is possible that all is not well in the Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sounds like the merest tinkle of discord outside Broadminster
      reverberates throughout the Close, causing uneasiness and even
      perturbation at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past three years there have been two threatenings of huge
      upheavals in Minster circles. The rumblings of an earthquake were heard by
      some people of acute hearing, and the local seismometer&mdash;her name is
      Lady Birnam&mdash;foretold a cataclysm. But happily the centre of the
      disturbance passed away in another direction, and the foundations of the
      Cathedral remained intact.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE INNOVATORS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he volcanic force
      which caused all the alarm was a young clergyman who, by reason of his
      personal merits and his relationship to the Dean, became the most minor of
      all the canons, and probably the most pleasing. But before he had been a
      year in attendance it was rumoured that he had views, and no clergyman
      with views had ever been associated with the services at the Minster.
      There have been clergymen who took a lively interest in landscape
      photography&mdash;even colour photography&mdash;and others who had rubbed
      with their own hands some of the finest monumental brasses in the country.
      A prebendary went so far in horticulture as to stand godfather to a new
      rose (h.p.), and a precentor who devised an automatic reel&mdash;a
      fishing-rod reel, not the terpsichorean&mdash;but no dignitary had
      previously been known to develop views on the lines adopted by this Canon
      Mowbray, for his views had an intimate connection with the Church Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been heard to express the opinion that it was little short of
      scandalous that people should enter the Cathedral and find themselves
      surrounded by beauties of architecture and facing combinations of colour
      in glass that were extremely lovely&mdash;that they should be able to hear
      music of the most elevating type efficiently rendered by an organist of
      ability and a well-trained choir, but the moment a member of the Chapter&mdash;one
      of the dignitaries of the Church&mdash;began to discharge his duties,
      either in his stall, at the electern, or in the pulpit, the congregation
      were subjected to an infliction of mediocrity sometimes verging on
      imbecility. It was little short of scandalous, he said, that the most
      highly paid functionaries&mdash;men whose education had cost a great deal
      of money&mdash;should show themselves so imperfectly equipped to discharge
      their simplest duties in an intelligent manner. Few of them could even
      intone correctly, and he had a suspicion that intoning was invented to
      conceal their deficiency in reading the prayers. When they stood at the
      lectern and read in that artificial voice that they assumed for the
      Lessons for the day, treating the most splendidly dramatic episodes with a
      tameness that suggested rather more than indifference, they proved their
      inefficiency as plainly as when they stood at the altar-rails and repeated
      the Commandments in that apologetic tone they put on, as if they hoped the
      people present would understand quite clearly that they, the readers, were
      not responsible for the bad taste of the compiler of the Decalogue in
      referring to offences of which no well-bred lady or gentleman would be
      guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he went on to refer to the preaching....
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Canon Mowbray did not give expression to his views all at once. He was
      forced to do so by the action of the Dean and Chapter after he had
      startled them all, and the congregation as well, by his dramatic reading
      of the First Lesson, which was of the discomfiture of the Priests of Baal
      by the prophet Elijah&mdash;a subject treated very finely by Mendelssohn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that Canon Mowbray had paid a visit to London every week in
      order to get a lesson in elocution from a well-known ex-actor, and at the
      end of six months had mastered, at any rate, the fundamentals of the art.
      His performance, regarded by itself, would have been thought quite
      creditable; but, judged by comparison with the usual reading of the
      Lessons in the Minster, it was startling&mdash;thrilling. Long before he
      had got to the ironic outburst of the prophet, &ldquo;Cry aloud, for he is a
      god,&rdquo; he had got such a hold upon his hearers that when he made a little
      pause the silence was striking. At the close also, when he had shut the
      Book and stood for a few moments before saying, &ldquo;Here endeth the First
      Lesson,&rdquo; the silence was the ecclesiastical equivalent to the plaudits of
      the playhouse at the effective close of an act: he might have said, &ldquo;Here
      endeth the First Act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if there was not a sirloin in Broad-minster over which the
      performance was not discussed. Sides were taken in almost every household
      of faith, some people condemning the innovation, others being enthusiastic
      in its favour. The one said it was too theatrical&mdash;it was not for
      clergymen to put themselves into a part, as if they were actors; the other
      affirmed that the Bible should be read by a clergyman as if he believed
      what he was reading, not in that <i>voix blanche,</i> as the French call
      the insincere monotone which for some reason, hard to discover, has been
      almost universally adopted as the voice of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a natural consequence of the discussion the attendance at the afternoon
      service was immense, for it was understood that Canon Mowbray was to read
      one of the Lessons. Men who had become quite lax in their churchgoing
      looked up their silk hats, and even chapelgoers, having heard of the
      morning performance, hastened to the Minster just to see how theatrical it
      was. The organist wished he had chosen a more showy anthem than &ldquo;In Judah
      is God known.&rdquo; This was quite too commonplace for such an occasion, he
      thought: it would allow of the clergy's competing with the choir for
      popularity, the idea of which was, of course, absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offertory was nearly double that of any afternoon of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt that the &ldquo;draw&rdquo; was Canon Mowbray. He filled the
      stage, so to speak; when he went to the lectern the effect was the same as
      is produced on a full house by the entrance of the &ldquo;star,&rdquo; and once again
      the silence was felt to be a subtle form of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canon Mowbray had no chance of electrifying his hearers, for they were
      expectant; he managed, however, to get far more out of an unemotional
      chapter than had ever been got out of it before, so that it was made
      perfectly clear to every one that he meant to pursue the line he had
      struck out for himself, and for the next few days there was no real topic
      in Broad-minster but the innovation of Canon Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not surprising that the Close should be greatly perturbed by the
      innovation. The Chapter was against it to a man. They had got into a
      groove so far as the church services were concerned, and they had been
      running very easily in it for many years. Where was the need to make any
      change? they asked. But even if some change was needed, why should it be
      such a one as that of which Canon Mowbray had made himself the exponent?
      There were the weaker brethren to consider: in every clerical discussion
      the question of considering the weaker brethren plays a prominent part.
      The weaker brethren objected very strongly to the introduction of
      elocution in any florid form at the lectern or in front of the
      altar-rails, and beyond a doubt the playhouse&mdash;a theatre is
      invariably alluded to as a playhouse by people who are arguing against it&mdash;the
      playhouse and the House of God are separate and distinct, and any attempt
      to introduce the atmosphere of the former into the latter savoured of
      irreverence, and should not be tolerated by any one having at heart the
      welfare of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Canon Mowbray was quickly made aware of the opinion of the
      Chapter regarding his innovation, and then it was that he made use of the
      somewhat intemperate phrases already quoted in defining the artistic
      incompetence of the clergy; and the clergy speedily learned all that he
      had said and was still saying about them, and they were naturally very
      much displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what could they do in the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was obvious that they could be cold to him&mdash;they could
      delete his name from the list of invitations to their whist parties and
      dinner parties and luncheon parties. They could make it difficult for him
      to get up a set at lawn-tennis or badminton; and, sure enough, they put in
      motion all the apparatus of excommunication which is still at the command
      of the Church. But the result was not all that had been anticipated; for
      the people who felt that they owed Canon Mowbray a good turn for the
      entertainment with which he had provided them for several Sundays, got up
      special parties in his honour: dinner parties, and whist parties, and even
      &ldquo;tweeny&rdquo; parties&mdash;the Sunday lunch between the services at the
      Cathedral which occupies so prominent a position in the convivial régime
      of Broadminster. But Canon Mowbray was wise enough not to accept any of
      the invitations that he received. He knew that there was far more to be
      got out of a pose as persecuted reformer than from appearing at the most
      elaborate tweeny lunch that the most interesting house in the town could
      provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite right; for within a month he was summoned before the Dean
      himself, and remonstrated with on the error of his excessive elocution. It
      was understood the great Dignitary had used his own weapons against him
      during this interview: his elocution was excessive as he referred to the
      Canon's attempt to introduce an element into the services which had
      previously been monopolised by the playhouse&mdash;the Dean, of course,
      called the theatre the playhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need scarcely be said that this interview of remonstrance represented a
      martyr's crown of 22 carats, hall-marked, to Canon Mowbray, and he took
      care to display it: he never appeared in public without it. He brushed his
      hair to accommodate its rim upon his head&mdash;every one who has come in
      contact with a martyr knows how far the brushing of his hair goes to the
      establishment of his claim to the crown&mdash;and it was understood that
      even if Canon Mowbray's &ldquo;size&rdquo; had been in excess of that marked on the
      ticket in his hat, it was nearly certain that within a short time his head
      would be found quite equal to the wearing of his crown without any one
      suggesting that it was a misfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had got the better of the Dean in the interview&mdash;he took care
      that this fact became known. He had not forgotten himself or his position
      for a moment. He had expressed his great regret that the Dean was unable
      to look at the question of the innovation with his, the Canon's, eyes; he
      had a great respect for the Dean's opinion on most matters, and he knew no
      one whose advice he would follow more gladly; but in this particular point
      he found it impossible to do so. Surely if the art of the musician was
      admitted into the services, the art of the elocutionist should not be
      excluded&mdash;and so forth. Good taste? He was said, that he could not
      allow any considerations of what some people called good taste to
      interfere with what he believed to be his duty. After all, good taste and
      bad taste were merely relative terms. It was not possible that on any
      aesthetic grounds Mr. Dean would be prepared to say that the slovenly
      reading of the Sacred Word to which they had been for long accustomed at
      the Minster was more tasteful than&mdash;than one in which the ordinary
      principles of elocution were observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when the Dean was confronted with arguments which he made no
      attempt to answer that he became grossly personal, Canon Mowbray said,
      attributing to him, the Canon, motives unworthy of a clergyman with any
      sense of his high calling, and thereby proving pretty conclusively, the
      Canon thought, that as an arbiter of good taste the Dean could scarcely be
      admitted to a position of any prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the Dean's remonstrance was to strengthen the Canon's cause
      in the eyes of his adherents; and when one of these friends wrote a letter
      to the newspapers, expressing the opinion that if Canon Mowbray had been
      guilty of any breach of discipline the ecclesiastical authorities should
      take action with a view to justifying themselves in the attitude they had
      assumed in regard to him, the general opinion was that the Canon had
      triumphed, for the Dean and Chapter knew perfectly well that they had no
      power to accept the challenge implied in the letter: the question was not
      one of turning to the east or turning to the west, or of lighting candles
      in a place where no artificial illuminant was required, or of wearing an
      overelaborate robe&mdash;it was solely a question of taste, and the
      discipline of the Church has nothing to do with matters of taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Lady Birnam, who claimed to be a local
      ecclesiastical seismometer, so to speak, prophesied a cataclysm that would
      shake the Church to its foundations. She went far beyond the advisory
      committee of St. Paul's in considering the consequences of making new
      subways by the London County Council.

      III.&mdash;THE PEACEMAKERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd yet within a
      couple of months the last rumble of the threatened disturbance had passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how the <i>status quo ante bellum</i> was restored:
    </p>
    <p>
      The offending Canon was in the habit of confiding in his supporters his
      feeling of sorrow that none of his clerical brethren had the manliness to
      follow his example and read the Lessons as they should be read: he had
      quite believed, he said, that in a short time the slovenly, monotonous
      reader would have ceased to appear at the lectern; he was greatly
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one Sunday an elderly Prebendary astonished every one by &ldquo;putting on&rdquo;
       two separate and distinct voices in reading the First Lesson. It was the
      chapter in which Moses pleads for the Children of Israel when their
      destruction is threatened by the Almighty. Now it will be plain to any one
      that to treat this duologue in an elocutionary style requires a delicacy
      of touch of the rarest sort; but unhappily the reader seemed to have the
      idea that all that was necessary to deal with the most important passages
      effectively was to deliver them in two voices, and this scheme he adopted.
      The one voice was that of a good-natured gentleman taking the part of
      naughty schoolboys who had been caught robbing the orchard of an irascible
      old farmer; the second voice was that of the irascible old farmer who had
      cornered them and had sent one of his staff for a dog whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was startling at first. It seemed as if the clergyman had seen
      Irving in <i>The Lyons Mail''</i> and thought he could not improve greatly
      upon the method of the actor in the dual rôle&mdash;speaking in the mild
      accents of the amiable Lesurges on the one hand and in the gruff staccato
      of Dubose on the other. At first this touch of realism was startling, but
      as it went on it became queer, then funny, and at last it had the element
      that made its emphatic appeal to most hearers, that of burlesque. Some of
      the congregation were shocked: they had no idea that &ldquo;God spake these
      words and said&rdquo; in the tone of a testy old gentleman. Others were frankly
      amused and showed it without reticence; and the entertainment closed with
      the giggling of choir-boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Second Lesson was read by Canon Mowbray in a very subdued way.
      Contrary to the expectation of a good many people, he made no attempt to
      match himself in realistic effects against the Prebendary; and when during
      the week remarks were made in his hearing respecting that member of the
      Chapter and his elocution, he only shook his head sadly. The other members
      of the Chapter could do no more. When an elderly clergyman has made a fool
      of himself within the precincts of his church people can only shake their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next Sunday the congregation who crowded the Minster at the
      afternoon service shook not only their heads but their bodies also in
      their decorous but wholly ineffectual attempts to smother their laughter
      while the Prebendary read a chapter in the Book of Ruth which
      necessitated, he thought, full orchestral treatment. He clearly saw the
      parts for a basso, a tenor, a soprano, and a contralto, and he set himself
      about doing all four by subtle modulations of his voice. Now, people do
      not as a rule mind a middle-aged parson's putting on a gruff voice when
      reading what a man said, or going up an octave or so when assuming the
      dialogue of a milder-mannered man; but when he puts on a falsetto, and a
      very high falsetto, when he essays to reproduce the words of a woman, and
      occasionally breaks in an attempt to lay the emphasis on the right words,
      the most decorous of folk will either laugh or weep&mdash;and the great
      majority of the worshippers in the old Minster this day did the former.
      Quite a number hurried from the Sacred Fane with their handkerchiefs held
      close to their mouths. But once outside&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was how the scandal which threatened to make Broadminster Chapter a
      house divided against itself was dispersed. It was obvious that the
      Minster was too antique a place to be made the scene of so great an
      innovation as Canon Mowbray had attempted to introduce, and he at once
      fell back into the recognised monotone, with a suspicion of the sing-song
      rising and falling from sentence to sentence in his reading of the
      Lessons, and the Prebendary once more followed his example; and so the
      plague&mdash;or worse&mdash;was stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the general impression that prevailed throughout Broadminster when the
      whole question of the innovation was discussed was that that middle-aged
      Prebendary had not gone very far in making a fool of himself. They had
      heard of a potent form of argument technically known as <i>reductio ad
      absurdum</i>, but they had never before had so signal an instance of its
      successful operation.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;THE VOX HUMANA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome years had
      passed before there was another little fluttering in the Minster
      dovecotes; but this time the disturbing element happily did not arise
      within the Chapter. The fact was that at the afternoon service one Sunday
      a voice of extraordinary charm was heard when the first of the hymns was
      begun. It was the voice of a professional soprano, and one of the finest
      <i>timbre</i> beyond doubt; but it was so clear and so resonant that, to
      make use of the verger's criticism whispered into my ear, it gave the rest
      of the congregation no chance whatsoever. Now every one knows that there
      is nothing so startling in a church as one voice ringing out even a single
      note above the vague cloud of sound, if one may be allowed such a phrase,
      that comes from a singing congregation. But here was a young woman who
      went through every verse of the hymn as though the volume of sound coming
      from the nave, the aisle, and the choir itself were only meant as a sort
      of background for her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course before the third stanza was reached the great majority of those
      who had been singing had ceased. They saw that, in the verger's phrase,
      they had no chance against so brilliant a vocalist; they turned their eyes
      upon the young woman, some of them with frowns of indignation, but others
      with frank admiration. But undoubtedly all were startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the second hymn began it was plain that the music presented no
      difficulties to the stranger; she sang as before with exquisite sweetness
      and expression, but still with a ringing clearness that suggested the song
      of the skylark soaring above a field of corncrakes. Even the efforts of
      the choir did not rise much above the melody of the corn-crakes in early
      dawn when that girl was singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally such an unusual display caused a considerable amount of talk in
      Minster circles. It was pronounced in many directions to be in extremely
      bad taste for any young woman to sing down a whole congregation in such a
      way; but while some people said it must be put a stop to at once, others
      declared that they had never had such a treat in their lives. (They
      probably meant for the expenditure that was represented by their donations
      to the offertory.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the wives of such members of the Chapter as were blessed with
      wives declared definitely that a stop must be put to so unreasonable a
      display of an undoubted gift, their husbands asked how they proposed to
      put a stop to it; and once again it appeared that, after all, the powers
      of a Cathedral Chapter are very limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inquiries were made as to who the singer actually was; but no one seemed
      to know her. She was a stranger, and was certainly not living in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Sunday brought about a repetition of the same rather embarrassing
      scene. The vocalist, who was a very handsome and an expensively but not
      showily dressed young woman, sang as before quite unconcernedly, and
      apparently oblivious of having done anything out of the common.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the first hymn, however, the organist's boy was seen to
      approach her, and to put a piece of paper into her hand. It obviously
      contained a message to which an answer was required, for the boy waited
      while she read the thing, and then she inclined her head, evidently
      signifying her assent to whatever suggestion it conveyed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who saw the act doubted that the organist had sent her a message,
      begging her not to sing quite so loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course the precentor announced that &ldquo;the anthem is taken from Job
      xix. verses 25, 26: 'I know that my Redeemer liveth... and though worms
      destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lovely notes of the organ obbligato were heard in the introduction,
      and then the people in the church became aware of the fact that the melody
      was not being sung by the usual choir-boy, but by the stranger; and never
      before had it been sung with such feeling or such an appreciation of its
      beauty. It was natural that the old Cathedral-goers should look at one
      another with startled eyes at first&mdash;here was an innovation indeed!&mdash;but
      before long the most hardened of them all had yielded to the exquisite
      charm of the girl's voice, and when the triumphant notes rang out there
      was no one who remained unmoved under that ancient canopy of Gothic
      arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that unhappily is the end of the whole story. The girl and the elderly
      lady who had come with her to the Minster walked away at the close of the
      service, and no one was able to say in what direction they went or whence
      they had come. No one in the town knew either of them. They had not been
      at any hotel, nor had they taken the train to London&mdash;the organist
      made it a point to be at the station to find out. That beautiful, singer
      might have been a celestial visitant sent as a special compliment to the
      organist of the Minster&mdash;it was rumoured that the views of the
      organist were strongly in favour of this theory&mdash;so mysteriously had
      she come and so utterly had she vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the week that followed that episode in the Minster little else
      was talked of in the town. The Chapter took the gravest view of the action
      of the organist in sending that note to the vocalist, asking her if she
      would kindly sing the solo: he confessed that he had done so. They said
      that it was quite irregular, and he acknowledged this also; in fact, he
      was ready to acknowledge every thing to which the Chapter took exception
      if they would in turn acknowledge that he had been instrumental in
      providing them with such an artistic treat as they had never known within
      the walls of the Cathedral. And then he began to laugh at them, for he
      knew that they all had a wholesome dread of him, from the Dean down. He
      broached that suspicion about the angel, and lectured them upon the good
      fortune of some people who had entertained angels unaware. He wondered if
      that mysterious vocalist had entertained them. If so, he hoped that they
      would contrive when intoning the prayers in future to end up within a tone
      or two of the note on which they had started.

      They smiled and were silent. Some of them thought that he had let them off
      easily enough. They were trembling lest he should go into particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that week there was a great deal of controversy in Church circles
      respecting the episode, and on the following Sunday the Minster was
      crowded; for it was rumoured that the organist had another anthem with an
      effective soprano solo which he meant to spring upon the Chapter in place
      of the baritone, &ldquo;What is man that Thou art mindful of him?&rdquo; which was on
      the board, in view of the reappearance of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was disappointed, however; the service was conducted as usual,
      for the soprano was not there, and Mr. Stone, the very capable baritone,
      had it all his own way in respect of the anthem. He never sang it better
      in all his life, and everybody went home disappointed, except perhaps the
      Chapter and their womenfolk, who had perceived how easily a vocalist of
      exceptional ability may in certain circumstances be the means of causing
      confusion in the conducting of the services of the Church.

      V.&mdash;THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am inclined to
      think that the people of Broad-minster are about the best informed of all
      people in the county in regard to general topics. But sometimes this
      opinion, which so many visitors form, is not confirmed by residence in the
      town. In these days, when one hears that it is impossible to educate a
      girl as she should be educated for less than £200 a year, one expects a
      great deal of knowledge from girls generally. A clergyman of the town, who
      is not connected with the Minster, is constantly telling me of instances
      that have come under his notice of the most expensively educated girls
      showing an amount of ignorance that should, but probably would not, make a
      Board School girl blush were it brought home to her. He assured me that
      the daughter of one of the Minster dignitaries, in seeing a casual
      reference to Elaine, had begged him to tell her in which of Shakespeare's
      plays she appeared: she herself had made a diligent search through that
      author without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely believe that such an incident had taken place, for I was
      under the impression that Tennyson was still read by girls; but a short
      time afterwards I overheard a couple of young women&mdash;one of them not
      so very young&mdash;talking on literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder had mentioned that she had read in a magazine that the best
      account of the great plague was in a book written by Defoe, and she
      wondered if the other girl knew what book it was in. The other shook her
      head, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not ask me; the only book of Defoe's that I ever read was <i>The
      Pilgrim's Progress</i>, and I never finished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might chance to know,&rdquo; said the other complacently,
      evidently not seeing her way into any side issue in respect of the
      authorship of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress.</i> &ldquo;I'm tremendously interested
      in something I have been reading on tropical diseases, and I thought that
      I should like to learn something about the old plagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fancy that both young women went through a course of English literature
      at their expensive school, and they probably would reply to your assurance
      that you knew the difference between Daniel Defoe and John Bunyan and
      their works when you were twelve years of age, that they could have done
      the same. What chance has Defoe against golf or Bunyan against badminton.
      If a girl only puts her heart into it she can forget between eighteen and
      twenty-four much that she has learned previously&mdash;at a cost of a
      couple of thousand pounds or thereabout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, I repeat, there is a great deal of intelligence to be found in all
      circles in Broadminster, and now and again one is confronted by some
      strong piece of evidence of original investigation on a historical as as
      well as a literary subject. Seldom, however, does one have an important
      logical conclusion to an apparently trivial incident enforced upon one
      with the same lucidity as characterised a lady's expression of surprise
      that the hallucinations of the great Duke of Wellington in the latter
      years of his life had not been commented on by any of his biographers.
      People were accustomed to laugh at the assertion of the Prince Regent that
      he had been present at the battle of Waterloo, and at the Duke's reply to
      him when appealed to for confirmation: &ldquo;Indeed, I have frequently heard
      your Royal Highness say so.&rdquo; But what about the Duke's own hallucination?
      Is it not recorded of him that upon one occasion, when watching the
      playing fields at Eton, he declared that the battle of Waterloo had been
      fought there? Yet although everyone knew that Waterloo was in Belgium, no
      one seemed to have noticed the extraordinary mental lapse on the part of a
      man who might reasonably be supposed to have the chief features of the
      locality impressed upon him. She added that she feared, if the error were
      not pointed out in time, the Duke's statement might become generally
      accepted, and so posterity might be led to believe that Napoleon's career
      had been brought to a close on the banks of the Thames, which was not a
      fact.

      VI.&mdash;THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MINSTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he effect of
      residing for some time in such a town as Broadminster&mdash;a community on
      which the shadow of an ancient Minster has rested for nearly six hundred
      years&mdash;is noteworthy. One breathes of the atmosphere that clings
      about the old stonework, and, in time, one is conscious of one's ideas and
      aspirations becoming assimilated with the traditions of the place. On a
      fine morning in summer even an Irishman feels himself to be an English
      Conservative&mdash;a genuine Tory of the good old days when boys were
      taught to touch their hats to a &ldquo;passon,&rdquo; and when it was a matter of
      common knowledge that the finest vintage ports were reposing in the
      cellars of the Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instance of the insidious influences of an atmosphere too strongly
      charged with Anglozone&mdash;one must invent a word to express this
      particular elixir of the cathedral town&mdash;came under my notice some
      years ago. A young American lady, after travelling about a good deal,
      settled in a beautiful old house in Broadminster. Rooms panelled with old
      oak, an oak staircase with well-carved newels and finials, and a room on
      the wall of which some frescowork of the fourteenth century had been
      discovered, completed the charm which the Minster bells began in the mind
      of the young woman, and she began to speak English as incorrectly as if
      she had been born in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met her one day wearing mourning&mdash;not exemplary mourning, but
      enough to induce a mild and conventional expression of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no, it was not for any near relation, she said; but surely I had
      forgotten that the day was the anniversary of the execution of the Earl of
      Strafford. What Strafford was that? Why, of course, Charles the First's
      Strafford. How could Englishmen be so neglectful of the memory of one of
      the greatest of Englishmen?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go into mourning for Strafford, I suppose you fast upon the
      anniversary of the death of Charles the First?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The martyrdom of King Charles is commemorated in some parts of the States
      in the most solemn manner,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Oh yes, I can assure you that we
      are Stuart in every fibre of our bodies. I am President of the White Rose
      Society of Chillingworth County, Massachusetts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not, I hope, active Jacobites?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;not just yet; but we can never acknowledge the Hanoverian
      succession. We owe the Hanoverians a grudge: it was a king of that house
      who brought about our separation from Great Britain. That old wound
      rankles still.&rdquo;

      I.&mdash;MR. BARTON'S HIGH NOTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE ARTISTIC
      INFLUENCES OF A CATHEDRAL with a good organist and a capable choir in any
      town cannot be questioned; and so it is that the concerts which take place
      with some frequency in Broad-minster and the neighbourhood are usually
      quite good. The members of the choir are always ready to sing for the many
      deserving objects that occur to the active minds of the organisers of
      amateur concerts. One of these ladies, however, made up her mind that
      people were getting tired of the local tenors, and resolved to introduce a
      new amateur, whom she had heard sing at Brindlington, for a concert she
      was getting up for the Ophthalmic Hospital. This gentleman's name was
      Barton, and he was said to be a very promising tenor of a light quality.
      He certainly behaved as such when he came to Broadminster to rehearse on
      the afternoon of the day preceding the entertainment. Dr. Brailey, the
      organist of the Minster, had kindly consented to play the accompaniments
      as usual, though his best tenor was to be superseded by the gentleman from
      Brindlington, and he attended the rehearsal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had got through the first stanza of the stranger's contribution&mdash;a
      song that the musician had accompanied hundreds of times&mdash;he found
      himself being instructed by Mr. Barton how to play the introduction to the
      second stanza. Then he found himself told that he was playing too loud:
      &ldquo;Keep it down, my dear sir, keep it down&mdash;this is not a pianoforte
      solo,&rdquo; said the amateur petulently, to the horror of everyone present,
      with the exception, apparently, of the musician; for Dr. Brailey only
      smiled and remarked that he hoped he would with practice be able to give
      the gentleman satisfaction. But even this course of suavity did not seem
      to produce a good impression upon the amateur: he continued grumbling,
      winding up by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose that will have to do,&rdquo; while he turned his back upon
      the musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the musician did not seem in the least hurt. He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in his seat at the piano the next evening when the new tenor came
      forward to sing his song. It occupied, of course, the best place in the
      programme, and the first stanza came off very well: the high note a bar or
      two from the close was in itself a feat, but the singer produced it
      correctly and hung on to it as long as he could, and Dr. Brailey gave him
      every latitude, not proceeding with the accompaniment until he had quite
      finished with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Dr. Brailey did a thing which he alone in the town could do: he
      raised the key a tone in attacking the second stanza without the singer
      being aware of it; it was only when he approached the same high note to
      which he had clung in the first stanza that he began to feel that he was
      not so much at his ease in forcing it again. He pulled himself together,
      however, and just managed to touch it&mdash;there was no thought of
      clinging to it now; he touched it and then hurried away from it down the
      scale, and under covert of the encouraging applause which the singer
      received the accompanist unostentatiously raised the key again as he
      dashed into the third stanza. Gratified by his previous success, the tenor
      went gallantly onward; again he realised that the high note would tax him
      to the uttermost&mdash;he felt that he was straining his voice to touch
      even a lower note. But what could he do? The copy of the song which he
      held trembled in his fingers; then he took a quick breath and made a dash
      for the high note.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never reached it&mdash;his voice broke upon it with the usual comical
      effect, and the young people in the audience yelled with laughter. A boy
      scout or two at the back of the hall thought the moment a propitious one
      for showing how accomplished they were in imitating the everyday sounds of
      the farmyard; and under such a volley, mingling with the laughter of the
      choir-boys, one of whom simulated the tremolo of a cat unable to fulfil
      its engagements in good time, and attempting to produce Chopin's Funeral
      March from the beginning with a far too meagre orchestra, the singer
      turned and almost fled from the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dr. Brailey who had to announce to the audience at the start of the
      second part of the concert that Mr. Barton, owing to a sudden
      indisposition, would be unable to sing &ldquo;Let me like a Soldier fall&rdquo;&mdash;the
      other song that was opposite his name on the programme&mdash;but that
      their old friend, Mr. Stamford, had kindly stepped into the breach and
      would do his best with that number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loud and prolonged applause,&rdquo; the <i>Gazette</i> stated, followed the
      announcement; for Mr. Stamford was the leading tenor of the Minster choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barton, carrying with him his three encore songs&mdash;he had come
      fully prepared to meet the preposterous demands of an enthusiastic
      audience&mdash;left Broadminster by the night train. And up to this day I
      believe that he does not know by what diabolic trick on the part of some
      one he made such a fiasco. He has been heard to declare that no persuasion
      will ever induce him to sing again in Broadminster, and, so far as I can
      gather, there is no likelihood of any machinery being set in motion to
      cause him to break his vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that the claim which the musical fraternity of Broadminster
      advance respecting the moral tone of their performances, whether given
      under the patronage of the Church or not, can certainly be maintained. The
      Kreutzer Sonata has been placed on the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> of the
      Concert Committee ever since Tolstoi wrote a foolish book pointing out
      whither that composition was likely to lead young people with a tendency
      toward voluptuousness; and when a lady of a sensitive nature but an open
      mind submitted to them a song which she had been advised to sing at a
      forthcoming concert, pointing out where in one line the writer of the
      words had, she thought, gone a little too far, they considered the matter
      with closed doors and all females excluded, and decided that her
      suspicions were but too well founded, and that the offensive line should
      be altered. This was done, and the honour of Broadminster was preserved
      intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the song was, &ldquo;It was a Dream,&rdquo; and the line objected to was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;We kiss'd beneath the moon's cold beam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of this shameless confession was mitigated by the substitution
      of the word &ldquo;met&rdquo; for &ldquo;kiss'd&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;We met beneath the moon's cold beam&mdash;

      II.&mdash;THE MUSICAL TABLEAUX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome people have
      been heard to affirm that there is too much music going on at
      Broadminster. There may perhaps be some grounds for the assumption. At any
      rate, it is certain that of late few concerts contributed to solely by
      local talent have paid their expenses. The opinion seems to be general
      that when the vocalists can be heard every day of the week free of charge
      in the Minster, people are unwilling to pay three shillings, two
      shillings, or even (back seats, unreserved) one shilling for listening to
      them at a concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time ago, however, when the annual Coal Fund was started, it was
      absolutely necessary to get up a concert to make a contribution to this
      excellent charity; and Lady Birnam undertook the direction of the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      After consultation with some friends from a distance who were supposed to
      have sounded all the depths of schemes for the relief of &ldquo;deserving
      objects,&rdquo; she came to the conclusion that music, illustrated by <i>tableaux
      vivants</i>, offered the greatest lure to the public. Such a combination
      had never been attempted in the town, and its novelty would make an appeal
      to the jaded palates of a concert-ridden community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of illustrating the music was quite a simple one. Certain
      dramatic songs were selected and scenery painted to form a suitable
      background for the episode treated in each; an illustrative group was
      arranged against such a background, and when the curtain was raised after
      the singing of each stanza it was like looking at the pictorial cover of
      the song itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, in &ldquo;The Village Blacksmith&rdquo; the baritone sang the first
      stanza, up went the curtain, and there appeared on the platform a living
      picture of the smith, brawny arms and all, in the act of raising a hammer
      to strike a very red-hot horseshoe. The next stanza sung was that which
      referred to the children looking in on the smithy, and when it was sung a
      charming picture was displayed of immaculate children standing around the
      door, while the smith neglected his work to pat them on the hair. The
      third tableau showed the interior of a church with the smith in the family
      pew raising his eyes pathetically as he hears his daughter's voice in the
      choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea seemed a very pleasing one, and it had the &ldquo;draw&rdquo; of novelty
      about it. It was found that several good songs lent themselves admirably
      to illustration by tableaux, and the young men and maidens were pleased to
      have the chance of posing in aid of a deserving charity. It so happened,
      however, that Mr. Stamford's mother died only a few days before the date
      of the first public performance, so that he was forced to remove his name
      from the programme. He was to sing &ldquo;She wore a Wreath of Roses,&rdquo; and the
      three groups that were arranged for the song were expected to be among the
      most effective of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stamford was very sorry to relinquish his intention of singing, but he
      promised the Committee to provide the best substitute possible to get, and
      this was a friend of his who occupied a position in a bank at Mallingham.
      He promised to communicate with this gentleman and to tell him what he was
      to do. He was sure to know &ldquo;She wore a Wreath of Roses.&rdquo; The substitute
      turned up in good time: there was, of course, no need for a rehearsal! Mr.
      Stamford had told him what he was to do, he said, and he preferred playing
      his own accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two sets of the evening were received with every token of
      approval by the audience: the songs were &ldquo;The Village Blacksmith&rdquo; and
      Pinsuti's &ldquo;Night Watch&rdquo;; and then the charming young lady in mid Victorian
      dress, and with a wreath of pink roses on her dark hair, posed on the daïs
      against a suitable background. The signal was given to the tenor, who was
      seated at the piano behind the curtain. He struck a few chords and began
      in excellent style.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He had actually got to the end of the first stanza before it dawned upon
      any responsible person that this was not the &ldquo;Wreath of Roses,&rdquo; and before
      he could be arrested he had declared that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Faithful below he did his du-i-ty,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And now-ow he's gaw-aw-en aloft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went the curtain, revealing a refreshing picture of the pretty girl in
      the muslin dress and the pink wreath, and after the usual interval for
      applause the curtain fell. Never had the applause been louder: it caused
      the members of the Committee who were preparing to strangle the singer to
      lose their heads completely, and the singer was well through the second
      stanza before they recovered themselves sufficiently to perceive that it
      was now too late to do anything, and he went on complacently to say that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Tom never from his word departed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and so on through the simple, pathetic stanza; and then the curtain rose
      and showed the charming young lady in white satin among her bridesmaids at
      the door of the church, and once again the applause was rapturous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above! what do the fools mean by applauding?&rdquo; whispered the
      chairman of the Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them go on if they please,&rdquo; said some one. &ldquo;They think that this is
      Tom Bowling's bride&mdash;his fidelity is rewarded, that's the moral
      illustrated. 'Tom never from his word departed'&mdash;there you are, you
      see. 'His heart was kind and soft,' and the combined virtues have their
      reward&mdash;<i>vide tableau.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then those of the Committee who had some sense of humour hastened into the
      anteroom to roar with laughter. They were still so engaged when the
      curtain rose for the third and last time, showing poor Tom Bowling's widow
      in appropriate garments. Having heard three times that Tom had gone aloft,
      it would have been ridiculous if any less pathetic scene had been shown to
      the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decent interval that elapsed before the applause came showed how
      deeply affected was the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the singer at the piano was pounced upon by the Committee and
      prevented from going on with his song. He protested that he had only sung
      three verses, and that he was bound to finish it; but the Committee were
      firm. Not another note would they let him sing, and he retired hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was questioned in the anteroom as to how on earth he came to sing &ldquo;Tom
      Bowling&rdquo; when Mr. Stamford must have told him that his song was to be &ldquo;She
      wore a Wreath of Roses.&rdquo; Did not Mr. Stamford tell him that? he was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he said that; but I wasn't going to sing that foolish,
      sentimental rot. Anybody who knows anything about music will agree with me
      in thinking that 'Tom Bowling' is worth a dozen of the other, and I'm
      supposed to sing 'Tom Bowling' rather well.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      This was the explanation given by the visitor, and it was commented on
      pretty freely by some of the Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the consensus of opinion among the audience and the critics was in
      favour of the belief that the tableaux illustrating scenes in the life of
      Tom Bowling&mdash;and his widow&mdash;were the most effective of the whole
      entertainment.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;THE DRAMA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t must be obvious
      to the least experienced that such a community as may be found in an
      artistic neighbourhood like Broadminster will take kindly to amateur
      theatricals. There are two dramatic clubs in Broadminster, and their
      performances are highly appreciated by the members and their friends. The
      rivalry between the two is quite amicable, for one set of amateurs devote
      themselves to the lighter forms of the drama and the other to the loftier,
      and perhaps they might be called without offence the heavier forms. It may
      be mentioned that the former are the more popular, but those persons who
      attend the representations of the latter consider themselves the more
      superior&mdash;as indeed they are; otherwise they would have accorded the
      tribute of a sunny smile to a little bit of dialogue, with accompanying
      action, which took place in a performance of <i>King Renes Daughter</i>
      which it was my privilege to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one place the King and the Moorish physician have had a long scene
      together, for the physician is certainly inclined to be long-winded. They
      go out together, and a couple of the courtiers enter the garden and
      express surprise not to find the others waiting for them. One of them says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King is gone, nor can I see the leech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the amateur had simply said the words, his meaning, I believe,
      unless I am over-sanguine, would have been understood. But when, after
      shading his eyes with a hand while he gazed into the distance of stately
      trees and saying, &ldquo;The King is gone,&rdquo; he bent his eyes to the ground and
      moved a stone or two about with his toe before adding, &ldquo;Nor can I see the
      leech,&rdquo; I am inclined to think he puzzled some of his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the curiosity to inquire what was in his mind when he sent his eyes
      roaming about the ground while he grubbed with his feet, and I learned
      that he thought it would be quite natural for any one searching for a
      leech to move the stones about to see if it was concealing itself in the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently under the impression that the wise physician was
      habitually followed by a pet leech, or perhaps that he had brought it with
      him to try what effect it would have upon the Princess's eyes, and that it
      had escaped through a hole in his waistcoat pocket.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;THE FRANK CANON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DO NOT THINK
      THAT, TAKING THEM all round, the Cathedral dignitaries of Broadminster can
      be accused of assuming a greater importance than is due to their position;
      but a story is told about a Canon, lately deceased, which goes far to
      prove that he at least did not shrink from putting forward what he
      believed to be a reasonable claim to distinction&mdash;relative
      distinction. It is said that he was in the one bookseller's shop which is
      still to be found in the town. It was Saturday evening, when a stranger
      entered and, after buying a book, inquired of the proprietor who was the
      best preacher in the place: he explained that he was staying over Sunday
      and was anxious to hear the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too delicate a question for the bookseller (with a clergyman at
      his elbow) to answer at a moment's notice; so he thought he would do well
      to evade the responsibility by referring the stranger to the Canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman is a stranger to the town, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he wishes
      to know who is the best preacher. I thought that perhaps you, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I am staying here
      till Monday, and I ventured to inquire who is the best preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best preacher, sir?&rdquo; said the Canon, looking up from the book which
      he was sampling. &ldquo;The best preacher? I am the best preacher, sir: I am
      Canon Hillman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was slightly startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, sir,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;And who do you consider the
      next best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next best is my brother, sir, the Reverend Theophilus Hillman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger raised his hat and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Canon Hillman had a reputation for that sort of frankness suggested
      by the story which I have ventured to repeat as it was told to me, and
      which I have no difficulty in believing, from the example I had of his
      manner several years ago. I was sojourning at an hotel between Nice and
      Beaulieu, and he appeared one night at table d'hôte dinner. It was the
      custom for the proprietor, who, curiously enough, did not speak or
      understand English, though he was a Swiss, to stand at the entrance to the
      <i>salle à manger</i>, bowing out his guests as they passed into the
      spacious lounge after dinner, and in returning his courtesy, people said a
      word or two in commendation of his cuisine, to which he responded with
      further bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened upon this particular night, however, that one or two little
      mistakes had occurred to mar the harmony of the repast as a whole&mdash;they
      were quite trifles&mdash;the <i>pré salé</i> being underdone and a jelly
      not having set with that rigidity which is expected in such comestibles,
      but which is not always to be found in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were filing out of the room I was almost immediately behind Canon
      Hillman, and I heard him grumbling to a man who had been at his table, but
      who did not seem to sympathise with him; and this went on until they had
      reached the bowing proprietor, when the Canon stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to tell you, sir, that I have never eaten a worse dinner at any
      hotel in my life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was not a dish that any one could eat&mdash;I
      consider it simply outrageous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not one word did the man understand, for the Canon had spoken in English.
      The proprietor smiled and bowed most placidly, saying&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Je vous
      remercie mille fois, m'sieur&mdash;votre compliment est très distingué&mdash;très
      gracieux; je suis heureux&mdash;merci!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had too hastily assumed that the clergyman had offered him the usual
      congratulations upon his cuisine, and he had replied with more than his
      customary politeness, the visitor having shown himself to be much more
      enthusiastic than the ordinary run of people had time to be, considering
      that most of them were counting the moments until they should be in the
      Casino at Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know who the very frank clergyman was at that time; but four or
      five years later I recognised him at Broadminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother, the second best preacher, assuming the correctness of the
      Canon's judgment, though perhaps it might have been reversed on appeal,
      was rector of one of the parishes, and it was rumoured that he was not
      disposed at any time to take too humble a view of his claims to
      distinction, however slow other people might be to admit their validity.
      It is said that upon one occasion, on his return from a visit to the Holy
      Land, he preached a sermon giving some striking examples of the fulfilment
      of prophecy in connection with the topography of Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was particularly struck with the accuracy
      of some of the details of the prophecies, when one day I was among the
      ruins of one of those cities referred to in the Sacred Writings. I had the
      Book in my hand, and I read that the land should be in heaps: I looked up,
      and there were heaps on every side. I read that the bittern should cry
      there: I looked up, and, lo, a bittern was standing there in its
      loneliness. I read that the minister of the Lord should mourn there. My
      dear friends, <i>I was that minister</i>.&rdquo;

      II.&mdash;THE &ldquo;CHARPSON&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he only clergyman
      in Broadminster who, so far as I have heard, was fully qualified to take a
      place in one of the Barchester groups was a person named Gilliman. He was
      a small, stout gentleman with a comical ruddy face and sparse, bristly
      grizzly hair. He had no benefice, but was one of those unattached parsons
      who, in the phrase of the servants' registry office, was ready to &ldquo;oblige&rdquo;
       either by the day or as locum tenens for an absent incumbent. He had been
      left a small competence by his mother&mdash;quite enough for a clerical
      bachelor to live on, and he was a bachelor. He never sought for a job, but
      when he got one he proved that he held fast to the excellent precept that
      the labourer is worthy of his hire. If any brother parson expected that he
      would take his duty out of love or zeal, that parson left himself open to
      disappointment. I think he would have made a worthy curate to Mr.
      Quiverful; but Mr. Quiverful would have felt so chastened in spirit by his
      proximity that he would have got rid of him within a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a zealous patron of the amateur, whether musical or dramatic. He
      could always be depended on to buy one of the cheaper, but never one of
      the cheapest, tickets for a concert or a comedy, and he seemed as pleased
      with the most incompetent amateur as with the best. He was socially
      unambitious; no one seemed to invite him to any function, with the
      exception of the Dean's annual garden party: he went to this, and so did
      every one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had been a resident in Broad-minster for several years
      that people found out why he had settled in that town. It might be
      supposed that there were enough clergymen here to serve as a reservoir for
      all the neighbourhood in an emergency. I once heard an American lady who
      was on a cathedral tour through Europe say just outside Santa Croce on a
      feast day: &ldquo;There are priests to burn in Florence if I do my sums right.&rdquo;
       Her slang meant that there was a superfluity of the clergy in that city,
      and perhaps she was right. I will not make use of her slang in referring
      to Broadminster, but assuredly it might strike anyone that there was a
      sufficient number of clerics in the purlieu of the Minster to meet the
      needs of the neighbourhood without making the presence of so accommodating
      a person as Mr. Gilliman a convenience. In an unguarded moment, however,
      he confessed to some one that years ago, when he had first come to the
      town, it was his earnest hope to drop into some vacant stall in the
      Minster. He had dreams of being appointed to a canonry by some fortunate
      combination of circumstances, and he had gone on waiting for such an
      accident, and meantime attending all the amateur performances in the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very good preacher, people said who had heard him, and others who
      had not heard him; but few were aware of how he managed to excel in a
      direction that seemed just the opposite to the bent of such a man. The
      truth was that his father had been a zealous rector of a parish in
      Devonshire, and had bequeathed to him a large sackful of sermons that he
      had preached to his flock since his ordination; and when the fortunate
      legatee was called on &ldquo;to oblige&rdquo; for an absent cleric, he simply put his
      hand into the mouth of the sack and drew out a sermon, put it into his
      pocket, and went away and preached it in due course, dropping it into his
      sermon sack on his return. Thus it was that people said he preached much
      better than they expected&mdash;and he probably did so; but he could not
      tell you the next day on what subject he had preached.
    </p>
    <p>
      That legacy and his impartial system of dealing with it served him in good
      stead; but upon one occasion it might have caused him to feel some
      awkwardness if he had not been so completely detached from his duty in the
      pulpit. The fact was that he had been called away at a moment's notice to
      take the duty for a clergyman who had knocked himself up by umpiring in a
      cricket match on a very hot Saturday. He had never been to the place
      before, so he had to look up trains and connections, and by the time he
      had got out of this maze the train that he had selected was almost ready
      to start. He hurried to the faithful sack and pulled out a fat sermon
      roll, and rushed away for the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lucky in catching the train and the subsequent connections, and
      arrived at the church with nearly half an hour to spare. He went through
      the service and found himself in the pulpit with his sermon opened on the
      cushion in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that the discourse which he had drawn in his usual way
      from the paternal sack was the valedictory sermon preached by his father
      in the church of which he had been rector for forty years, and there was
      the son beginning it in a church which he had never seen before that
      morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite unconscious of any want of felicity in his choice. He began
      the sermon and went through with it, feeling no qualm. He had every
      confidence in the orthodoxy of his father; he would never get into a
      scrape through preaching what the dear old man had preached years ago. And
      so he went onto tell his congregation that more than forty years had
      passed since he had first stood before them to preach the Gospel of Truth,
      and that every year of that forty he had stood where he was standing
      to-day, Sunday after Sunday&mdash;that he saw before him aged men and
      women whom he had known as young men and maidens&mdash;that by the favour
      of Heaven he had lived to baptize the offspring of those whom he had
      himself baptized in their infancy&mdash;yea, unto the third generation he
      had come, and now he was standing before them for the last time. The hour
      of parting had come, and would any among them say that that hour was not
      bitter to them all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no one did go so far as to assert that the hour was not bitter to
      them all. I was assured that the congregation were bathed in tears, so
      affected were they by the thought that the clergyman who had &ldquo;obliged&rdquo; for
      the day was about to vacate the pulpit for ever. They felt the blow deeply&mdash;much
      more deeply than the parson seemed to feel it, for he managed to hold back
      his tears so long as he was in the pulpit, though his marvellous powers of
      self-repression may have deserted him an hour later, and he may have
      broken down utterly in the train when making the return journey; the
      chances are, however, that he did nothing of the sort, for he had not the
      remotest idea what the sermon had been about.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the strangest thing of all in connection with this incident is that
      the churchwardens expressed themselves as greatly pleased with the sermon,
      and one of them referring to it the next day in the hearing of my
      informant, said he had never been so affected in his life as he was under
      the influence of the sermon, and he hoped that the eloquent clergyman
      would be able to preach it again in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite likely that his wish was gratified, though I do not think that
      any one who had the best interests of the Church at heart would advocate
      the adoption of the farewell tours system of the popular actor or singer
      by the clergy. It might hurt the susceptibilities of some members of a
      congregation to hear a clergyman bid an affecting farewell to a crowd of
      people who were complete strangers to him, and the sincerity of his sorrow
      might be called in question when they reflected that an ordinary man can
      scarcely be broken-hearted at the thought of never seeing again the faces
      he had never seen before. But that, of course, involves the question of
      how far the susceptibilities of the weaker brethren should be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      My informant, who was present upon the occasion referred to, was also a
      stranger to the place. He was staying with the doctor's family, and,
      walking home from the church, the doctor's wife remarked how beautiful the
      sermon had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rector bears his age very well,&rdquo; said her companion. &ldquo;He does not
      look a day over forty, and yet, according to his own account, he must be
      at least sixty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our rector? But that clergyman is not our rector,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Our
      rector is ill; the one we had today came to do duty for him. He is a
      stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then, should he talk of having baptized half the congregation
      and married the other half&mdash;of never having been absent from the
      pulpit for forty years and more?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are hypercritical!&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;Some latitude should be
      allowed to clergymen. He only made use of one of the figures of speech of
      the pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is recorded of the same estimable charpson&mdash;if a parson who also
      discharges the duties of a squire has been called a squarson, may not one
      who goes out like a charwoman by the day be called a charpson?&mdash;that
      upon one occasion he was asked to do duty for an absent clergyman at a
      village in Hampshire, but the contract was for the morning service only.
      When he was disrobing in the vestry after preaching the ser mon, a couple
      of churchwardens approached him on the subject of the evening service
      also. He said that he would be very pleased indeed to take the evening
      service, but of course he should have to receive another guinea. The
      churchwardens demurred. They said they thought that, as he was on the spot&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that that has anything to do with the case,&rdquo; said the
      clergyman. &ldquo;One service and sermon, one guinea; two services and two
      sermons, two guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officials agreed that the article was marked in plain figures; but
      still they thought&mdash;&mdash; Well, would he consent to take the
      evening service for another half-guinea?
    </p>
    <p>
      After thinking over the proposal, the clergyman consented to do so; and
      then one of the wardens suggested that perhaps Mr. Gilliman would not mind
      saying just a few words&mdash;not a sermon&mdash;not a regular sermon, of
      course, but just a few words&mdash;to the congregation after the evening
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some further thought Mr. Gilliman said he would have no objection to
      say a few words in this way, and the wardens thanked him and handed him a
      sovereign, a half-sovereign, a shilling, and a sixpence. They went so far
      as to pay him for the evening in advance, to show that they had unlimited
      confidence in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his part he resolved to prove to them that their confidence in him was
      not misplaced; so, after reading the evening service, he came to the front
      of the altar-rails and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear brethren, I have been asked to say a few words to you at this time
      instead of preaching the customary sermon. What I wish to say to each and
      every one of you whom I see assembled before me&mdash;and what I think it
      is the intention of your churchwardens that I should communicate to you&mdash;is
      that there will be no sermon in this church to-night. Let us sing, to the
      praise and glory of God, the ninety-second Hymn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He easily caught the late train to London, though the evening service in
      respect of trains is much more irregular than that at which he had
      presided in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Herbert Gilliman, B.A.Oxon, never received preferment; but
      some one remarked to me after his death, when touching on his career, that
      far less worthy parsons had been appointed to a cure of souls by the
      patrons of livings, without the parishioners having any voice whatever in
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with him, and said that I thought they managed these things
      better in Scotland, where the candidate minister preached once or twice to
      the congregation to allow of their judging of his powers before they
      accepted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;I think that the application of the hire-purchase
      system in these matters is highly desirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not exactly the hire-purchase system,&rdquo; said a purist in phrases. &ldquo;It
      is more of the 'on sale or return' system of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in my mind,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;was a tasting order for spirits in
      bond.&rdquo;

      III.&mdash;THE BIBLE CLASS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> prefaced my
      repetition of passages in the career of the Reverend Herbert Gilliman with
      an expression of my belief that he was the only cleric in Broadminster who
      suggested to me one of the slightly shop-soiled clergymen in Anthony
      Trollope's Barchester novels. Of the ladies of the Close or the ladies of
      the Palace I have never heard of one who, in the remotest degree,
      suggested a relationship with Mrs. Proudie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard, however, of the recent appearance of a lady, who is said to
      have an intimate acquaintance with the Greek language, at the weekly
      meeting of the Bible class, presided over by the Dean, who, it is said,
      has also got some knowledge of the same tongue. The Minster Bible class is
      one of the most exclusive of lady's clubs. It is understood that no one is
      eligible for membership who has not been presented at Court&mdash;at least
      so some one, who was not a member, affirmed. Another defined it as a sort
      of religious Almack's; but it was a man, and a clergyman into the bargain,
      who said it was an attempt to run an eighteenth-century French salon on
      Church of England lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without resembling Mrs. Proudie in even the most distant way, the lady of
      whom I have heard has succeeded, I am told, in changing the whole
      character of the Bible class&mdash;all through her knowledge of Greek.
      Without being in any way insolent or even self-assertive, she has, I think
      I am right in stating, openly differed from the interpretation put upon
      certain passages by the Dean himself; and no human being in Broadminster
      is recorded to have differed from the Dean on any point whatsoever. But
      she was a stranger and apparently unacquainted with the best traditions of
      the town; and, moreover, it was the Dean himself who invited her to join
      the Bible class. And when she suggests quite a different interpretation of
      a text from that advanced by the Dean, referring him to certain of the
      newest &ldquo;readings&rdquo; as her authority, he does not seem to be in the least
      irritated; indeed, on one occasion, when the question arose as to the
      exact shade of St. Paul's meaning when he made use of the particle <i>ôi</i>,
      the Dean was understood to say that he thought the lady's suggestion well
      worthy of consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the higher orders of the clerical establishment&mdash;those who are,
      so to speak, &ldquo;on the strength&rdquo; of the Chapter&mdash;those to whom the
      great Lord Shaftesbury would have given, without the reservation of a
      single finger, his whole hand to shake&mdash;are not, however, so meek as
      Mr. Dean, and it is whispered that two or three of them have recently been
      keeping the Bible class at a distance, while others, in view of being
      called on to preside at one of its meetings, have been seen searching on
      their bookshelves for Liddell and Scott and blowing the dust off the
      edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the old members of the class are declaring, however, that in future
      they will make complete ignorance of Greek an essential to membership. The
      very existence of a Bible class assumes ignorance, and no one has any
      business to belong to it who is capable of differing from the Dean, or, at
      least, who is sufficiently tactless to express such a divergence of
      opinion even though she may be sure of her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a show of feeling in this matter goes far to assure Broadminster that
      there is no chance of Mrs. Proudie being tolerated in the diocese.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was walking down the principal street of Broadminster&mdash;the
      street on which the leading silversmith and the leading draper have their
      premises&mdash;there went past a very high carriage. I hesitate to refer
      to it as &ldquo;well appointed,&rdquo; this chapter not being one of a novel, and,
      besides, I do not quite know what is meant by a well-appointed carriage;
      but the vehicle to which I refer was high, its horses were well matched
      and good steppers, and the coachman and footman were also a match pair.
      The young person with whom I was walking bowed to the occupants of the
      carriage&mdash;a young cleric and an extremely goodlooking and
      well-dressed lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice looking people,&rdquo; I ventured to remark. &ldquo;You know them, it would
      appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know them? I should think I do know them: he is our curate,&rdquo; replied my
      companion, who was, I may mention, the daughter of a clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Church is looking up when curates sit behind high-stepping bays,&rdquo;
       said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the best curate we ever had,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is the most obliging
      man ever known. He never grumbles at having to take both services some
      Sundays and to preach as well&mdash;a splendid preacher, too&mdash;never
      longer than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly and with something of awe in her voice. &ldquo;He is a
      one bisquer at croquet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to catch sight of the carriage and its bays, but it must have been
      a mile away by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he does all that out of the hundred and fifty pounds a year your
      father pays him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does indeed, eked out by the five thousand a year his father left him:
      his father was Sir Edmund Bonnewell, the great contractor. You have heard
      of him?&rdquo;
     </p>

      I had.

      IV.&mdash;THE ENCYCLOPÆDIC PARSON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is impossible
      that every one should be fully informed on all points even in so
      enlightened a community as Broadminster; but there is one clergyman who
      has a reputation for being the most artful fisherman in the Close, and of
      being always able to answer any question that may be put to him by the
      most casual inquirer. I heard him discussing the origin of a fire that had
      taken place in the town a few days before, and, as is usual in these days,
      it was said to have been due to a short circuit in the electric wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wondered what a short circuit is,&rdquo; said a lady. &ldquo;Can you
      tell me what it is, Mr. Tomlinson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A short circuit? Oh, it's very simple,&rdquo; said the fully informed parson.
      &ldquo;A short circuit is when&mdash;when&mdash;oh yes, when it is only a very
      short way from the electric lamp to where the wire is joined on to the
      cable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that causes the fire?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course&mdash;it is bound to, sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why they don't make it longer then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's the way they scamp everything nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only a few days had passed before I heard him telling another lady of the
      good luck that had attended the pottering about bookstalls indulged in by
      a brother parson in a neighbouring town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote to me a few days ago, to tell me that he had picked up a genuine
      'Breeches' Bible for sixpence,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and only a short time before he
      bought a fine Aldine for fourpence. What luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;I'm afraid that I forget what a
      'Breeches' Bible is, Mr. Tomlinson.&rdquo; He laughed good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, what is a 'Breeches' Bible?&rdquo; she asked coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite ready for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A 'Breeches' Bible?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, a 'Breeches' Bible is the one that
      was carried by Cromwell's troopers in their pockets; it was made specially
      for carrying about&mdash;small, you know, and compact. I remember reading
      that several of the soldiers had their lives saved owing to the bullets
      having lodged in the volume in their breeches pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;How very interesting! I do believe that I
      heard something like that having happened, I forget where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if the Reverend Mr. Tomlinson was not, after all, something of
      a humourist&mdash;if he was not engaged in that delicate dynamic operation
      known as &ldquo;pulling her leg.&rdquo; I had good reason to know some time
      afterwards, however, that there was no foundation for my suspicion in this
      direction. He spoke what he imagined must be true, and he was too lazy to
      verify his own conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lady asked him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what might be the real value of one of those Bibles?&rdquo; he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything from a thousand pounds up. I believe that one was bought by an
      American a short time ago for over four thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Not really? A thousand pounds?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Will you kindly give me
      his address? I must write to him for a subscription for our new bells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake don't tell him that you heard of his good luck from
      me,&rdquo; cried Mr. Tomlinson.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he recognised
      Church charities of Broadminster are numerous and constantly increasing.
      To be connected in some way with a charitable organisation seems to offer
      an irresistible attraction to some people, chiefly ladies; and every now
      and again a new lady starts up in Church circles with a new scheme of
      compelling people to accept alms or the equivalent, or of increasing the
      usefulness of the Church. The amount of time these masterful persons
      expend in reading papers embodying the most appalling of platitudes of
      sentiment, and betraying even a more astounding ignorance of political
      economy than a Chancellor of the Exchequer has ever revealed in a Budget
      speech, is astounding. All these papers, so far as I can gather, assume
      that only what their patrons call &ldquo;the lower classes&rdquo; stand in need of the
      reforms they suggest. They take it for granted that a cottage-mother, who
      has had perhaps thirty years' experience of making a pound a week do duty
      for twenty-five shillings, stands in need of instruction at the hands of a
      mansion-mother who cannot keep out of debt with an income of a thousand a
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were a person in authority with a voice in framing the conditions
      which must be conformed with by all ladies who put themselves forward in
      the advocacy of some of these great social schemes, I would decree that no
      lady who uses a tortoiseshell lorgnette with a long handle should be
      permitted to read a paper, or to receive the <i>laissez-passer</i> of any
      organisation to a house the valuation of which is less than twenty-five
      pounds a year. As a medium of insulting patronage, nothing that has ever
      been invented approaches in power this particular weapon in the
      well-gloved hands of a well-furred, middle-aged lady who studies with some
      reason all advertisements addressed to those with a tendency to stoutness.
      (I have gone a long way about to avoid hurting the susceptibilities of any
      one.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once did I see an attack with this weapon successfully repulsed.
      There was an extremely pretty girl in the centre of the drawing-room, when
      a couple of those ladies whose existence I have hinted at entered and
      immediately began a frontal attack through the glazed tortoiseshell with
      the long handles, and the little forced smiles that accompanied the
      movement showed them to be old campaigners. They brought the pretty girl
      into focus, conning her from head to foot and exchanging whispered
      comments upon the result of their scrutiny. The girl saw them, and, to
      paraphrase the poet, they &ldquo;by tact of trade were well aware that that girl
      knew they were looking at her&rdquo;; but that fact had no effect upon them.
      They continued their scrutiny and their whisperings, and I saw the girl's
      face become rosy. But then I saw that she was &ldquo;limbering up&rdquo; and would go
      into action in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did. She was talking to an elder lady, who might have been her mother,
      and the latter had one of the same long-handled glasses lying on her muff.
      In an instant the girl had possessed herself of it, slipped it off its
      swivel, and was using it precisely as the others were using theirs, only
      returning their fire, so to speak. Then she whispered something over her
      hand to her companion, who laughed outright. That was enough for the
      attacking force: their battery was silenced; but the girl refused to
      withdraw, and for quite five minutes, I think, they were well aware that
      her eyes were upon them. Wherever they went they felt that they were still
      within her range, and that her innocent smile was playing about them. I
      never saw two more uneasy ladies in my life, and I trust that they learned
      their lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most singular point in this connection is that the girl was known to
      her friends as shy and retiring by nature&mdash;a less self-assertive girl
      could not be imagined. It seems to me that there is a lesson to be learned
      from this fact in addition to that which it is to be hoped she taught her
      elders, who certainly did not possess her shyness: it is the lesson of the
      rousing of a feminine instinct of defence, which is exhibited in another
      form when the defence is that of offspring. Even the most timid feminine
      thing will act in direct opposition to its reputed nature when called on
      to defend its young; and even the most retiring girl may assume an
      offensive attitude under the provocation of poised tortoiseshell and
      elevated eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am pretty sure that that nice girl, when she went home and was alone
      in her room, sang no song of Miriam as she recalled her triumph. No, if
      she did not shed some tears at the thought of how she had behaved in so
      unaccountable away, I am greatly mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of the administration of charity has yet to be written; but
      when such a work is taken in hand I trust that a chapter will be devoted
      to the self-denying industry of the Misses Gifford. These two elderly
      ladies are the daughters of a deceased jerry-builder, and they enjoy a
      large income, the greater portion of which is derived from insanitary
      house property; and they are devoted to good works, including the
      amelioration of the condition of the poor. Every year they issue
      invitations to a show of their good works at their own house, and these
      are found to take the form of coarsely knitted woollen socks, thick
      mufflers made of the cheapest materials, petticoats constructed out of
      blankets that have been consigned to the rag-basket, and aprons out of
      tablecloths that have been rescued from the dustbin. Some of the articles
      of clothing seem to represent in themselves the heterogeneousness of a
      jumble sale, and all are cheap, shoddy, and shapeless. And yet this pair
      of feminine philanthropists show all comers round the room where they are
      exhibited with sparkling eyes and faces glowing with proper pride at the
      result of their industry. They worry the local newspapers for a paragraph
      that shall make all the world acquainted with their benevolence, and now
      and again their importunity is rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      What becomes of the conglomeration of horrors which they create in the
      name of charity no one seems to know; but it is impossible to imagine any
      self-respecting family so far forgetting what is due to themselves as to
      wear such things. For themselves, it is well known that the Misses Gifford
      never forget what is due to them, or to insist on its payment on the day
      that it becomes due. They have a brother who, without being an active
      philanthropist, is well worthy of them. He collects the rents from their
      insanitary tenements, and he does so with a ruthless hand. There is no
      measure of bluff or bluster of which he is not a master. But there are
      scores of people in their own town who see the dear old maiden ladies in
      church and say that they remind them of <i>Cranford</i> and <i>Quality
      Street!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But knowing as I did a good deal about them, I was reminded more of an
      earlier work still in which the devourers of widows' houses were said to
      be Pharisees as well. Such a pair of feminine Pharisees as those whom I
      call the Misses Gifford&mdash;Gifford is not, of course, their real name&mdash;are
      hardly to be found outside their own town.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;A CONGENIAL PURSUIT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O MENTION OF
      BURFORD WOULD BE complete unless two-thirds of the account were given over
      to its croquet ground and its croquet practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exhaustive, or even a perfunctory, reference to sport is out of place
      in any description of the lighter side of life in the provinces, for
      people in all levels of life take their games very seriously, and croquet,
      as played nowadays, is the most serious of pursuits. Clergymen who
      practise it habitually seek for relaxation from the strain its seriousness
      imposes on them in the pages of the Fathers. It is a matter of common
      knowledge that a clergyman in charge of a parish in Burford invariably
      writes out his sermons during the three-ball breaks of his opponents. It
      is supposed to be <i>de rigueur</i> for a player who has let his, or her,
      opponent 'in' to take no interest whatever in that opponent's strokes when
      making a break. It is supposed that if you pay any attention to your
      opponent's play you may put him, or her, off; and so scrupulous are some
      players lest they should put an antagonist off, they occasionally stroll
      off the court and return with a bored look only when they are sent for.
      But the chivalry of the habitual croquet players really knows no bounds.
      Another of their characteristics is absolutely quixotic. It takes the form
      of walking off the court as if the game were already finished when an
      opponent has yet to make three or four hoops before pegging-out; the
      object of such a move being, of course, to give an opponent more
      confidence at a critical moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a doubtful point, however, and I have never heard it decided by a
      referee, if this object is likely to be effected by a losing player
      breaking the handle of her mallet across her knee when she has failed to
      shoot in; though one cannot doubt that only a spirit of self-denial
      actuates such a player as makes a point of placing in the form of pennies
      on a chair, at the opposite side of the court from where she sits, the
      bisques to which her opponent is entitled, thus putting herself to the
      trouble of walking across, interrupting her opponent's play when the
      latter had taken a bisque, in order to remove one of the pennies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who sneer at croquet are those who have no knowledge of the
      game as played nowadays on such courts as there are at Broadminster. There
      is no more scientific game, nor is there one that demands a more unerring
      judgment, a steadier hand, or a clearer eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Croquet seems to be the ideal game for the freak, the cripple, or the
      aged. One of the best players in the neighbourhood is the chaplain to a
      lunatic asylum. He has a large amount of practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past few years the champion lawns have been invaded by
      schoolboys and schoolgirls, with the result that some of the best prizes
      have been carried off by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot imagine a more melancholy sight than that of half a dozen healthy
      boys, who should be at cricket or lawn-tennis, solemnly and slowly
      knocking the balls through the hoops and stolidly going through the
      operations of &ldquo;peeling,&rdquo; &ldquo;laying up,&rdquo; &ldquo;wiring,&rdquo; and the like.

      II.&mdash;THE PLAYERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut even croquet
      has its lighter moments. I witnessed a match some time ago between a
      well-set-up cavalry officer (retired with the rank of Major-General) and a
      cub of a lad&mdash;a slouching, hulking fellow whose gait showed that he
      had never had a day's athletic training. The boy won and went grinning off
      the lawns. His mother received him with grins, and the General walked away
      in the direction of the river. It occurred to me that people should keep
      an eye upon him. But he did not even fling his mallet into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned up a little later at another court, and this time he was
      victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      But against whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Against a stout elderly lady crippled with rheumatism; and he just managed
      to beat her through making a lucky shot!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me to be marvellous that, with the possibilities of such
      humiliation before players, any except the decrepit should be found
      willing to take part in tournaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt, however, as to the absorbing power of croquet upon
      certain temperaments. I have met an elderly lady of Early Victorian
      proportions who, I am positive, can recollect the details of every match
      she has ever played. If she were not able to do so she would sometimes be
      compelled to sit in silence, for to her conversation means nothing beyond
      a recapitulation of her croquet games. Try her as you may upon other
      topics, it is no use. She seems intensely bored if you touch upon the
      theatre, and to music and the other arts she is rather more than
      indifferent. Indifference might be represented as &ldquo;scratch,&rdquo; but her
      attitude can only be represented by a minus sign. On art she should be a
      -3, on music a -6, and on literature a -20. These are her handicaps, so
      far as I am capable of judging.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is the terror of the managers of tournaments, such a hole-and-corner
      game as she plays. She never leaves anything to chance: she invariably
      sends herself into a corner. Her most dashing game occupies four hours. It
      is said that she has strong views on the subject of assimilating the game
      of croquet with the game of cricket in regard to the duration of a match.
      If it takes three days to play a cricket match, why should not the same
      limits be extended to a croquet match? she wishes to know. The reply that
      is suggested by the people with whom she has played is that even at a
      three-day match she would complain bitterly that she was hustled by the
      managers. At present her life seems a perpetual complaint. During the
      season she grumbles her way from tournament to tournament; and when she
      seats herself by the side of an unwary person to watch a match, even
      though it is a final for the cup, she immediately begins to describe one
      of her games&mdash;it may be one that took place five years before&mdash;and
      keeps on giving detail after detail of trivialities, with a complete
      disregard of the excitements of the court where she is sitting and the
      applause of the crowd at some brilliant play&mdash;on she rumbles, unless
      her unwilling confidant rises and flies for covert. It takes her even
      longer to describe one of her games than it does to play it. Her latest
      complaint is that croquet players are becoming very unsociable, the basis
      of her charge being that when she approaches a court to sit down and watch
      a game, the people on the chairs whom she knows quite well get up and go
      away. She does not believe that in every case they do so, as was
      suggested, to give her a choice of chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thinks that those should remain whom she has known for some years. It
      does not appear ever to have occurred to her that they get up and fly
      because they have known her for some years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another <i>devotée</i> has become so absorbed in her cult as to become
      upon occasions an embarrassment to her relations. Of course no one makes
      any remark upon a player thinking of nothing besides croquet: it is
      assumed that a lady who means to become a player will not waste time
      thinking about anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Man's croquet is of man's life a thing apart.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Tis woman's sole existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That is acknowledged as only reasonable; but it must sometimes be
      embarrassing to the relations of this lady when at a dinner party she
      refuses an offered entrée on the ground that she is wired, or when she
      checks a neighbour for taking a meringue because he or she has previously
      been playing with the green. It appears quite feasible to me, however,
      that the green of the salad and the white of the meringue should suggest
      to a thoughtful croquet player the need for such a caution as is
      attributed to her on good authority; nor do I think it so very
      unreasonable that on allowing herself to be carried on a 'bus beyond her
      destination, through thinking out a croquet problem, she should, on being
      informed by the conductor that the vehicle went no farther, say&mdash;&ldquo;What
      a fool I was not to take a bisque sooner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is said that this same lady caused a considerable flutter in a railway
      carriage one day when she was working out another croquet problem, and was
      heard to mutter&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I shoot now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any time I chanced to look in at a croquet tournament on the beautiful
      lawns at Broadminster I came away with a laugh, and upon more than one
      occasion I found that the laugh was against myself. Long ago I was
      accustomed to look with a pathetic interest at the reappearance year after
      year of the beautiful mother of a beautiful daughter at the tournament.
      Surely, I thought, there could not be a more pathetic sight than that of a
      mother with a picturesque home and a husband, setting out from both, early
      in the month of June, when the rosery is becoming a paradise of blossom,
      and travelling from country town to country town and from one hotel to
      another, without intermission until October, for the sake of being by the
      side of a daughter who has given up her life to the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh came in when I found that the mother was more devoted to looking
      on at croquet than the girl was to playing the game! The pathetic figure
      was really the daughter, who was acting as companion to her mother to
      enable her with propriety to gratify her passion for watching people play
      croquet. The daughter complained a little at first, but now she says she
      has come to see that she should be unselfish and sink her own inclinations
      so that her mother may have some innocent enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looks very carefully after her mother, and is even able sometimes to
      exchange a few words with her at intervals during the day's play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I found this out I have never allowed myself to be carried away in
      pity for one who elects to play the part of onlooker at a game of croquet.
      People who spend their time looking on at croquet are deserving of no
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been told that when hospitality is offered to some of the visitors
      by people in Broadminster during the tournament week, it is now not
      invariably accepted without caution and preliminary inquiry. A bitter
      story was imparted to me by a man who had been kindly invited by one of
      the inhabitants to stay at his house for the croquet week. My friend
      gratefully accepted, and as the whole of the local family were players, he
      was brought up to their villa after the first day's play. He found the
      house a charming one of its class, and he thought himself lucky in his
      billet. Dinner was served, and then the little rift within the hospitable
      lute was suggested: there was no wine offered to him! The hissing of
      syphons round the table gave expression to his views on the subject of
      such hospitality; but what could he say in reply to his host when the
      latter turned to him, remarking quite pleasantly&mdash;&ldquo;This is a teetotal
      household: no strong drink of any kind is allowed to enter it. Will you
      have soda water or Appolinaris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was nothing to be said by a guest on the subject; but his
      host, like so many people professing his principles, had a good deal to
      say respecting the virtue of teetotalism. But so far as I was able to
      gather from the tone of his narrative, he did not obtain the cordial
      concurrence of his guest in all his views; for his guest was in the habit
      of taking half a bottle of claret at his dinner every day of his life and
      at least one glass of sound port afterwards, and for twenty years he had
      not gone to bed without wrapping himself round a tumbler of grog at the
      eleventh hour, and he did not find that an exordium on teetotalism went
      far to compensate him for the absent decanters. He was ready to greet the
      discourse with hisses; but the syphons were accommodating: they did their
      own hissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to bed in a very bad humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, however, after family prayers, his host said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I detected an unsatisfied look on your face as you entered the
      room, my friend. I think I know the reason of it. I dare say you have been
      accustomed to something which you failed to find on the table in your
      room. I am sure of it. I have inquired, and I am very sorry for the
      omission. But make your mind easy; look on your table to-night, and I
      think you will be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not so bad, the visitor thought; though not everything, still a
      whisky and soda going to bed was better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had his customary claret at his lunch in the pavilion that day, so he
      did not mind the sibilant but unsatisfying syphons at dinner. But he felt
      tired that night, he said, and went oft early to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Switching on the light, he hurried to the table for the promised treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that the table bore nothing except a large Bible, bound in
      leather!

      I.&mdash;THE ARTISTIC OUTLOOK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> GOOD MANY PEOPLE
      ARE OF THE opinion that Art and the appreciation of Art are making
      considerable progress in this country, but others are inclined to be
      despondent on this subject; and among the most despondent is an estimable
      clergyman of a parish some miles from Broadminster. He told me that he was
      confirmed in his pessimism by observing the popularity of the imitation
      half-timbered, red-brick cottages which country architects are running up
      by the hundred in every direction. &ldquo;The foundation of all true Art is
      Truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and yet we are confronted daily with all the falsehood
      of creosoted laths curving about ridiculous gables in imitation of the old
      oak timbering. People hold up their hands in horror at the recollection of
      the outside stucco of the early Victorians; but where is the difference
      between the immorality of pretending that bricks are stone and of
      pretending that creosoted laths are old timbers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course he had many other instances of the inefficiency of the Schools
      of Art to fulfil the object of their establishment: there was the villa
      fireplace, for example, suggesting that its delicate ornamentation was of
      the fine paste of Robert Adam, when it was simply a horrible thing of cast
      iron; and what about the prevailing fashion in ladies' dress?...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time, he thought, that steps were taken by men of genuine artistic
      feeling to put people on the right track in regard to Art in daily life;
      and he expressed to me in confidence the belief that a change could best
      be brought about by an appeal to the sense of beauty inherent in
      womankind. He begged the co-operation of one of the Minor Canons at the
      Cathedral at Broadminster, who had achieved fame on account of his
      artistic tendencies, and this gentleman consented to deliver an address at
      a specially convened mothers' meeting in the parish-room of the reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his promise, as every one knew he would. He delivered an address
      on &ldquo;The Influence of Cimabue on the later works of Donatello&rdquo; in the
      presence of forty-two matrons, nearly all of whom could both read and
      write; and it was understood that he proved up to the hilt every statement
      that he made, and any of his audience who may have had some doubt as to
      the part that Cimabue played in the development of the genius of Donatello
      must have left the hall feeling that they could no longer hesitate in
      accepting the relative position of the two artists as defined by the
      lecturer.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0307.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The next address is, I hear, to be made on the subject of &ldquo;The Cinquecento
      and its Sequel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is the way to popularise Art in the country districts. When once the
      wives and mothers of the farm labourers and the shepherds of the Downs are
      brought to understand the importance of taking a right view of Cimabue and
      the Cinquecento, then Art will become a living thing in this country&mdash;perhaps
      even sooner: who can tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally practical was the response made by a wealthy gentleman who has
      recently settled near Brindlington to the appeal of the parson to
      contribute something to the loan collection with which he hoped to second
      the efforts of the Minor Canon to stimulate an appreciation of good art in
      his parish. In charge of a traction-engine of large horse-power there was
      brought in a stone-mason's lorry to the door of the hall a full-size
      powerful group by Monsieur Rodin, representing an episode in the life of
      the most flagrantly humorous faun that ever grew, or half-grew, out of a
      rock under the rough-hewing chisel of the great French artist. At first
      one did not know that one was looking at a piece of sculpture&mdash;one
      seemed to be looking into a stone quarry. But gradually the idea revealed
      itself, and then one rather wished that it hadn't. The faun was not one of
      Nature's gentlemen: you could see that at once; but after a while, with
      good luck, you became aware of the fact that there was a nymph, or what
      looked like a nymph, scattered about the quarry&mdash;yes, you could see
      it quite distinctly from certain standpoints, and when you did you rather
      hoped that you had been mistaken. It was a masterpiece that &ldquo;Group by M.
      Rodin.&rdquo; It might have been taken for a freak of Nature herself&mdash;one
      of those fantastic rocks which are supposed to suggest the head of the
      first Napoleon or perhaps the Duke of Wellington wearing his cocked hat,
      or it may be a huge lizard or, if properly humped, a kneeling camel. But
      whatever it was, there stood the stone quarry brought to the very doors of
      the hall wherein were &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; all the objects of Art contributed by the
      less ambitious collectors of the neighbourhood, and within were six
      stalwart men preparing to rig up on a tripod of fifteen-feet ash poles
      each as thick as a stout tree, a tackle of chains and pulleys for shifting
      the thing from the truck to the rollers by which it was to be coaxed into
      the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not get it beyond the porch. The tiled pavement crumbled beneath
      it like glass, and the caretaker of the building was doubtful about the
      stability of the floor within. In the porch it remained until the parson's
      wife, who had heard the noise of the traction-engine and felt sure that
      something was going on, arrived upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a glance at the landscape within the porch, and then ordered a
      dust-sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the &ldquo;Group by M. Rodin&rdquo; was worth more than all the loans within
      the building; but it was not everybody's group. It remained in the
      friendly obscurity of the dust-sheet except when some visitor with
      inquisitive tendencies begged for a glimpse of it. Then the parson,
      averting his eyes, lifted up a corner of the dust-sheet, and remarked that
      he was sure that the work would be a noble one when the great sculptor
      should have cut away all the superfluous stone that lay in great masses
      about the figures; but even in its unfinished condition anyone could see
      that it could not weigh much under five or six tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy that the gentleman who had contributed this loan was more of a
      humorist than the parson had suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I think is the most disappointing feature in connection with the
      development of Art in the provinces is the lack of interest shown in
      certain districts in the local productions. The producers are not without
      honour save in their own county. Of course, if it became a question of
      saving money, there would be patrons enough of local art; but unhappily
      the possible patrons are incapable of estimating correctly the money value
      of such things, and they prefer to give five pounds for a picture by an
      artist a distance than two for one by a local man, even though they might
      be assured by some one capable of pronouncing an opinion that the cheaper
      work was the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years ago I was made aware of a curious example of this
      characteristic of some places. It occurred to an enterprising printseller
      at Broadminster that a spring exhibition of works in black and white might
      attract attention and enable him to do some business; and with the
      co-operation of some of the London publishers he managed to get together
      over two hundred capital examples of modern work, including some proof
      etchings by Le Rat, David Law, Frank Short, Legros, and others. A local
      lady, who was understood to be a liberal and well-informed patroness of
      Art in various forms, visited the exhibition and was greatly attracted by
      an etching of a spring landscape. Finding the price moderate, she bought
      it and carried it home with her in her brougham. A week later, however,
      she returned with it to the printseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that the Cuthbert Tremaine who did this is only a local man?&rdquo;
       she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The printseller assured her that she was quite right: Cuthbert Tremaine's
      people belonged to the town, and he had been educated at the Grammar
      School and the School of Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was quite fair of you to hang that from such a person
      among the etchings that co-exibit here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was quite able to hold his own among the best of them,&rdquo; said the
      printseller. &ldquo;He's coming well to the front, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that it is at all fair to your customers to try and foist
      off upon them the work of a local man,&rdquo; said the lady severely. &ldquo;An
      ordinary local man! I wonder very much at your doing such a thing. I have
      brought the etching back to you, and you must change it for me. You really
      should have told me that Cuthbert Tremaine was nothing but a local man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So much for the encouragement of local talent in our county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite recently a more striking instance of this peculiarity was offered us
      in a neighbouring town. A local artist held a sale exhibition of
      water-colour drawings of scenes within a radius of six miles. There were
      perhaps thirty of these, and every one of them was good, and every one of
      them was pleasing. There was no suggestion of slovenliness about any, nor
      was there a hint of an amateur. They were not the sort of drawings that
      might be referred to as &ldquo;highly creditable&rdquo;&mdash;nobody wants to possess
      &ldquo;highly creditable&rdquo; things: they must have positive merit, without taking
      into consideration the conditions under which they are done, before any
      one who knows something about art would wish to possess them; and the
      watercolours in this exhibition could certainly claim to be in this light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, cards of invitation were sent to some hundreds of possible buyers,
      and were heartily responded to, for free exhibitions are very popular in
      our neighbourhood, especially those that take the form of a demonstration
      of a new breakfast cereal (with samples gratis). But in the matter of
      sales the response was not quite so hearty as it might have been. The
      artist did not clear five pounds during the fortnight that his exhibition
      remained open.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month or two later, however, a stranger exhibited a collection of his
      drawings in the same town, and although they were infinitely inferior in
      almost every way to those of the local man, they found quite a
      satisfactory number of purchasers, notwithstanding the fact that there was
      not a drawing that was not priced at more than double the sum asked by the
      local artist for his sketches.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;ART AND THE SHERIFF
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut before the end
      of the summer an opportunity was given to connoisseurs in the same town to
      acquire, at the expenditure of a few pounds, a collection of pictures that
      would do credit to any private gallery in the kingdom. Announcements
      appeared placarded on every dead wall that &ldquo;by order of the Sheriff&rdquo; a
      magnificent collection of paintings by Turner, Reynolds, Gainsborough,
      Lawrence, George Morland, David Cox, and numerous other Masters, as well
      as drawings by Birket Foster, Keeley Hallswelle, George Cattermole, and a
      host of others. Being a Sheriff's sale this superb collection was to be
      disposed of without reserve, and the pictures were to be on view in the
      spacious commercial-room of an hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      People flocked to the place where these treasures were hung, and as a
      knowledge of pictures is born with most people, they were not slow to
      appreciate the fact that at last a chance had come to acquire at a merely
      nominal cost pictures by artists of world-wide fame. Most persons had read
      of the enormous prices brought by some prints after pictures by George
      Morland, but here were the actual pictures themselves in frames of the
      finest Dutch metal: no frames protected the high-priced prints in
      Christie's! And not merely was Morland highly represented here, but quite
      half a dozen exquisite <i>genre</i> pictures by Josef Israels were to be
      seen in a row, and it was whispered among the cognoscenti that this
      painter had just died and the <i>Studio</i> had contained an eulogistic
      article, with illustrations, on his work! Another chance! Of course Sidney
      Cooper's &ldquo;Cows in Canterbury Meadows&rdquo; spoke for itself. Every tyro knew
      that no one could ever paint cattle like Sidney Cooper. And Birket Foster&mdash;no
      one could ever approach Birket Foster in showing children swinging on a
      gate. There was the gate, sure enough, and the children, and the pet lamb&mdash;all
      the genuine Birket Foster properties. And &ldquo;by order of the Sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a treat to see the <i>cognoscenti</i> examining the pictures,
      subjecting individual works to the severest tests of light and magnifying
      glasses, and then whispering gravely together in corners on the subject of
      their merits. Some of them had pencils, which they had pressed to their
      lips while they scrutinised the masterpieces, preparatory to making notes
      on their catalogues&mdash;all just like a London picture sale in King
      Street, St. James's Street, London, W.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then some fool came into the room and laughed. He was a man who
      pretended to know a lot about pictures, and he was usually disposed to
      question the authenticity of things in the possession of everybody but
      himself. He glanced around the walls and went away, still laughing, after
      being in the place no longer than three minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a trick on his part, the <i>cognoscenti</i> said. He wished to
      put them off buying and so make a haul for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were confirmed in this belief when the one dealer in the town told a
      gentleman, who had come to him with a commission to purchase some of the
      pictures, that the man had just been to caution him against buying any of
      them on his own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that they are being hawked round from town to town, and that they
      are really all fakes&mdash;that there is not a genuine picture among the
      lot, and that the Sheriff's sale is not a <i>bona fide</i> one, but one of
      the oldest tricks of picture fakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the knowing person said to the dealer&mdash;&ldquo;Does he mean to say that
      in a town like this any man would dare to put 'by order of the Sheriff' at
      the top of the bill if it was not <i>bona fide?</i>He would pretty soon
      find himself in trouble. You attend the auction and bid for the numbers
      that I have marked in the catalogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The auction came off and was largely attended by the public, but, strange
      to say, by not a single outside dealer, only by the local one who had
      received many commissions. And a fortnight before an ordinary sale at a
      private house in the town, at which half a dozen pictures by fourth-class
      artists, and some only &ldquo;attributed to&rdquo; these artists, drew dealers from
      places fifty and sixty miles away!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed pretty clear that the Sheriff had not taken a great deal of
      trouble to advertise this particular sale&mdash;he could not have given it
      his personal attention, or perhaps he had never before had a chance of
      handling the &ldquo;fine arts&rdquo; on so opulent a scale, or the dealers would
      certainly not have missed the chance of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this may be, the pictures were bought by the dozen, as much as six
      pounds being given for each of the Israels, and a pair of Birket Foster's
      fetching ten, frames included in all cases. There was a keen struggle for
      the Turner, and it was run up to nine pounds&mdash;not by any means too
      much for a Turner as things go nowadays. Altogether, I suppose, about
      fifty pictures were sold. At the evening sale the auctioneer announced
      that a sufficient number had been disposed of to satisfy the Sheriffs
      claim, but that a gentleman in the trade had bought the remainder <i>en
      bloc</i>, and instructed him to put them all up for sale to the highest
      bidder; and he would have great pleasure in carrying out his instructions.
      On went the bidding down to the last lot, and so ended a memorable picture
      sale&mdash;probably the last of the kind to be perpetrated in England, for
      within a fortnight the gentlemen under whose direction the enterprise had
      been carried on from place to place for several years were arrested,
      tried, and convicted of perjury in making an affidavit with intent to
      deceive the Sheriff of some county and cause him to issue his writ for the
      sale of their bogus pictures. Fifteen months' imprisonment was certainly
      not too long a sentence for these practitioners; though really one can
      have but little sympathy for people who are such fools as to expect to buy
      pictures, with a name value of thousands of pounds, for a few shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for several weeks after the sale the fortunate purchasers of the bogus
      masterpieces lost no opportunity of exhibiting their treasures. Teas and
      At Homes were given to enable their less alert friends to. appreciate
      their varied charms, for it was understood in the town that the
      educational value of great works of art should not be neglected; and at
      the Mayor's Reception a short time afterwards two of the pictures were
      exhibited, for the educational benefit of the company, in their original
      Dutch-metal frames&mdash;the sort that one may buy for half a crown in a
      cash chemist's. In these days the man who had laughed at the private view
      was referred to in accents of scorn. But he continued to laugh, even when
      in the most kindly spirit he was advised by one of the successful bidders
      to remember that it was distinctly slanderous to suggest that a sale
      conducted under the auspices of the Sheriff of the county was a bogus
      affair. Then it was that the critic laughed loudest; and, so far as I can
      gather, he is laughing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      One interesting point was brought out at the trial of the men. It was in
      respect of the actual manufacturer's price of the fraudulent pictures. The
      artist who had executed them was put into the box and stated that he
      received from five to fifteen shillings for each. The average trade price
      of a George Morland worked out at a fraction over seven shillings, so that
      to refer to these works as valueless would be wrong: those purchasers who
      were fortunate enough to secure good specimens of George Morland at the
      sale have the satisfaction of dwelling upon their varied beauties and
      reflecting that the actual value of each work is in the bogus market
      something between seven shillings and seven and twopence! (The &ldquo;Sheriffs
      Sale&rdquo; price of a Morland was six pounds.)

      III.&mdash;THE COUNTRY PICTURE SALE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was once present
      at a picture sale in a mansion some miles from a country town in which I
      lived. There were, I think, three full-length Gainsboroughs, five
      Reynoldses, a few Hoppners, two by Peters, and three or four by Northcote.
      I was standing in front of a man by the first-named painter, and was lost
      in admiration of the firm way in which the figure was placed on the floor
      in the picture, when a local dealer approached me, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I have a word with you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I told him to talk away. I knew the man very well. He was one of
      those useful dealers of the variety known as &ldquo;general,&rdquo; from whom one may
      occasionally buy a Spode plate worth ten shillings for three, or an odd
      ormolu mount for sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to know if you believe these to be genuine pictures, sir,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genuine pictures!&rdquo; I repeated, being rather puzzled to know just what he
      meant; but then I remembered that he was accustomed to attend sales where
      pictures labelled &ldquo;Reynolds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gainsborough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Murillo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moroni,&rdquo; and so
      forth were sold for whatever they might fetch&mdash;usually from fifteen
      shillings to a pound, the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; never being so much as breathed
      by anyone. When I recollected this I laughed and said&mdash;&ldquo;Make your
      mind easy. If these are not genuine pictures you will never see any come
      under the hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think they will fetch?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not give you the slightest idea,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but if you can get
      me that one in front of us for five hundred pounds I'll give you
      twenty-five per cent, commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You must be joking, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I should have said a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, sir, how far would we be safe to go for them all? There are
      four of us here, and we are ready to make a dash for them if we had your
      opinion about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my good man,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You may reckon on my giving you five
      hundred pounds for any picture in this room that is knocked down to you.
      I'll put that in writing for you if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not necessary, sir,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;We'll buy the lot of them for you
      for less money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, and I shall be a rich man afterwards,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the auctioneer, who was an Irishman, after disposing of
      several lots of ordinary things, reached the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn't say anything about them,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;They speak for
      themselves: I think you'll all agree with me that there's not one of them
      that isn't a speaking likeness. What shall we say for this one&mdash;No.
      137 in the catalogue, &ldquo;Lady Betty&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; by Sir
      Joshua Reynolds? Look at her, ladies and gentlemen, and tell me if you
      think there are many artists in this county who could do anything better
      than this&mdash;all hand painted, and guaranteed. What shall we say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pound,&rdquo; suggested my dealer quite boldly. The auctioneer turned a cold
      eye upon him for a moment, and then I saw that there was a twinkle on its
      glossy surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A pound is bid for the picture&mdash;twenty-five
      shillings, thirty shillings, thirty-five, two pounds&mdash;thank you, sir;
      we're getting on&mdash;two-ten; I'm obliged to you, ma'am&mdash;three
      pounds ten&mdash;three pounds ten&mdash;three pounds ten bid for the
      portrait of Lady Betty. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, wouldn't it be a shame
      if such a picture was to be knocked down for seventy shillings and it
      worth nearly as many pounds. Four pounds&mdash;thank you, sir. The bidding
      is against you, ma'am. Well, if there's no advance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was my dealer who had made the last bid, and I must confess that for
      some seconds I actually fancied that I was to be placed in possession of a
      Reynolds for four pounds!
    </p>

      &ldquo;Four pounds&mdash;going at four pounds,&rdquo; came the voice of the
      auctioneer. &ldquo;If there's no advance&mdash;going at four pounds&mdash;going&mdash;for
      the last time&mdash;five hundred&mdash;six hundred&mdash;seven hundred&mdash;a
      thousand&mdash;fifteen hundred&mdash;two thousand&mdash;guineas&mdash;five
      hundred&mdash;guineas&mdash;three thousand&mdash;guineas&mdash;going for
      three thousand guineas, ladies and gentle-men, it's giving the picture
      away that I am; but still the times are bad. Going at three thousand
      guineas&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;Mr. Agnew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hammer fell, and everyone was laughing except the Irish auctioneer and
      my dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps our dashing friend will give me an advance of thirty shillings on
      the next lot&mdash;Ralph, first Earl of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said
      the former, glancing toward the latter with an insinuating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter forced his way toward the nearest door, leaving Lot 132 to be
      started by a London dealer at a thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      My disappointed friend had never been at a great sale in his life, and he
      had certainly not suspected that the gentlemen wearing the silk hats were
      like himself, dealers&mdash;only on perhaps a somewhat more heroic scale.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;HUMOURS OF THE ROSTRUM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he humours of the
      auction-room deserve to be dealt with more fully than is in my power to
      treat them. Though an auctioneer's fun is sometimes a little forced, its
      aim being to keep his visitors in a good temper with him&mdash;for he
      knows that every time that he knocks something down to one person he hurts
      the feelings of the runner-up&mdash;still, now and again, something occurs
      to call for a witty comment, and occasionally a ludicrous incident may
      brighten up the monotonous reiteration of slowly increasing sums of money.
      I have heard that long ago most lords of the rostrum were what used to be
      called &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; and got on the friendliest terms with the people on
      the floor. But now I fear that there is no time for such amenities, though
      I heard one of the profession say, announcing a new &ldquo;lot&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hallo,
      what have we here? 'Lot 67&mdash;Adams Bed.' Ladies and gentlemen, there's
      a genuine antiquity for you&mdash;Adam's Bed! I shouldn't wonder if the
      quilt was worked by Eve herself, though I believe she was better at
      aprons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The auctioneer as a rule, however, hurries from lot to lot without wasting
      time referring to the charm of any one in particular. I cannot understand
      how they avoid doing so sometimes when a beautiful work of art is brought
      to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the old days I believe that now and again a trick was resorted to
      with a view to arouse the interest of possible purchasers in the business
      of the day. I know of such a little comedy being played with a good deal
      of spirited action in an auction-room in a large townin the Midlands. An
      Irish dealer was in the habit of sending round from time to time as much
      stuff as a large furniture van would hold, to be offered for sale by
      auction. Of course he placed a reserve on every article, and if this
      figure was not reached in one town, he packed up the thing, to give it a
      chance in the next; so that within a few weeks he managed to get rid of a
      large number of things at quite remunerative prices. It so happened,
      however, that he wanted money badly when he reached the town where he
      began his operations, and he made a confidant of the auctioneer, who
      promised to do his best in regard to the goods. The articles were
      consequently displayed in the rooms, and a considerable number of people
      assembled before the auctioneer mounted the rostrum. The bidding was,
      however, very spiritless, and the first dozen lots were knocked down to
      imaginary buyers at imaginary figures; but just when the thirteenth lot
      was exhibited there appeared at the farther end of the room a rather
      excited figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop the sale,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'm not going to stand passively by while you
      give my goods away. I don't mind a reasonable sacrifice, but I'm not going
      to submit to such a massacre as has been going on here up to the present.
      Stop the sale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you here, Mr. O'Shaughnessy,&rdquo; said the auctioneer. &ldquo;Massacre or no
      massacre, I received instructions from you to sell your stuff without
      reserve, and sell it I will, whatever you may say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do nothing of the sort, I tell you,&rdquo; cried the Irishman. &ldquo;Come
      down from that reading-desk and don't continue to make a fool of me. I'm
      not going to see my things thrown away. You know what they are worth as
      well as I do, and yet you knock them down for a quarter their value!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my good man, if you don't get out of this room I'll have to take
      stronger measures with you,&rdquo; said the auctioneer. &ldquo;I know that the stuff
      is all that you say it is; but that's nothing to me: the highest bidder
      will get the best of it, whether he bids to half the value or a quarter
      the value for that matter. You are making a fool of yourself, Mr.
      O'Shaughnessy, but you won't make a fool of me. I'm here to sell, and sell
      I shall. Now sit down or leave the premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not sit down. I tell you I'll not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porter,&rdquo; cried the auctioneer, &ldquo;turn that gentleman out, and if he won't
      go quietly call a policeman. You hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A couple of stalwart porters approached the vendor, saying soothing words;
      but he refused to move, and they had to force him to the door. They did
      so, however, as tenderly as possible; though he kept on shouting, as he
      went reluctantly backward step by step, that the auctioneer was in a
      conspiracy to ruin him, allowing his goods to be taken away for nothing.
      At last he was in the street and the door was closed. &ldquo;Ladies and
      gentlemen,&rdquo; said the auctioneer, &ldquo;I must apologise for this scene. Such a
      thing never happened in my mart before, and I hope it will never happen
      again. But I know my position, and I've no intention of breaking faith
      with the public, whatever that man may do or say. I hope you'll excuse
      him; he is really the best judge of antiques I ever met, but when he gets
      a drop of drink there's no holding him in. Now, gentlemen, he'll not
      disturb us again, and with your leave I'll proceed with the sale. I'll do
      my duty by you, and I'll do my duty by him, whether he has insulted me or
      not. He maybe an excitable Irishman, but that's no reason why we shouldn't
      do our best for him. Fair play, ladies and gentlemen, fair play to
      everybody. We must not allow our prejudices to blind us. You know as well
      as I do that the stuff is the finest that has ever come to this town,
      though the vendor would be safer in the hands of the police than prowling
      about as he has been. Now where were we?&mdash;ah, Lot 13&mdash;'Chippendale
      mirror, carved wood, gilt.' There's a work of art for you. Where did he
      get hold of such a thing, anyway? What shall we say for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing started at a figure actually above the reserve price that Mr.
      O'Shaughnessy had placed upon it, and the bidding went on with a rush. The
      next lot&mdash;two ribbon-carved mahogany arm-chairs&mdash;seemed to be
      badly wanted by some one. They were knocked down at a figure twenty-five
      percent, beyond the reserve. So it was with everything else in the
      collection. Never had there been a more successful sale in the same rooms.
    </p>

    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      alt="327 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      So, at least, the auctioneer confessed to the vendor as they dined
      together that evening, and the auctioneer was in private life a truthful
      man, though not always so rigid in the rostrum.

    <h2>
      V. THE ARTFUL AND GOLDSTEIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>pon another
      occasion, in the same town, there was a dealer's sale at an auction mart,
      and it went off pretty well, though naturally a good many lots remained
      undisposed of at the close, for on every article there was a reserve price
      representing the profit to accrue to the vendor, with the auctioneer's
      usual ten per cent. One of the unsold pictures had attracted the attention
      of a gentleman who had bid as far as twelve pounds for it, and when the
      sale was over he remained in the mart waiting to see if it should be
      claimed by a dealer, so that he might have a chance of getting it at a
      slight advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the auctioneer very frankly confided in him that it had not been sold:
      the vendor, unfortunately, knew a good deal about pictures and had put a
      pretty stiff reserve on it. At this moment a local dealer showed signs of
      being also attracted by the picture. He stood in front of it, and seemed
      to be assessing its value to the nearest penny. After a few moments he
      jerked his head to bring the auctioneer to his side, and with a word of
      apology to the possible purchaser the auctioneer went to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a whispered conversation together, but every whisper was clearly
      audible to the layman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the dealer, &ldquo;you know that I bid up to eighteen pounds
      for that picture. Well, I'm willing to go to the length of twenty for it,
      if you're selling it privately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I can't oblige you, Mr. Goldstein,&rdquo; said the auctioneer. &ldquo;You
      know as well as I do who the vendor is, and you know that he is as good a
      judge of a picture as any man living. You know that the picture is worth
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what's the good of talking to me like that?&rdquo; said Mr. Goldstein. &ldquo;I
      don't deny that the picture is a good one&mdash;one of the best you ever
      handled&mdash;but a man must live. I believe I have a customer for that
      thing, but I look to make a bit off it for myself, and I must have it
      cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn't twenty-five pounds cheap for such a work?&rdquo; asked the
      auctioneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't deny it,&rdquo; replied the dealer, &ldquo;and that's just what I expect to
      get for it; but where do I come in in the transaction if I pay you that
      for it? Do you fancy I stick in auction-rooms all day by the doctor's
      orders? I'll give you twenty-three pounds for the picture, and if you
      can't let me have it for that you may burn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The auctioneer laughed and walked away without condescending to reply, and
      with a grimace of ill-humour Mr. Goldstein left the auction-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo; asked the would-be purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Goldstein,&rdquo; replied the auctioneer. &ldquo;He's a picture dealer,
      and about as knowing as they are made. He has been nibbling at this ever
      since it was left with me. Of course he'll come back for it. He's no fool.
      He knows a good thing when he sees it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The auctioneer strolled down the room to his office, leaving the gentleman
      to digest the information which he had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the gentleman was quite an astute person, and it did not take him long
      to perceive that a picture that is worth twenty-three pounds to a dealer
      named Goldstein is certainly worth twenty-five to a layman, so the
      auctioneer was not surprised when he entered his office, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that twenty-five pounds was the reserve for that picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the vendor's reserve, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll take it at that,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the auctioneer, and he smiled knowingly as he
      added, &ldquo;I may tell you that Goldstein offered me twenty-three for it just
      now. He'll be back with me offering twenty-five within the hour. I can
      imagine his face when he hears that it's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His shrewdness did not deceive him. Mr. Goldstein was back at the mart
      within half an hour, with inquiries about the picture, and it was with an
      air of triumph that the auctioneer told him that it had been sold. It is
      also quite likely that the look which he said he would like to see on Mr.
      Goldstein's face when he heard that the picture was sold was exactly the
      one which was worn by Mr. Goldstein, though it might not be just the one
      which the purchaser of the picture would associate with an expression of
      chagrin on the face of a person named Goldstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that Mr. Goldstein was grinning quite pleasantly; for Mr.
      Goldstein was the vendor of the work of art, which he had bought for four
      pounds and had disposed of for twenty-five, less auction fees!
    </p>
    <p>
      This auctioneer was an unusually clever man. He was heard to confide in a
      friend his impression that the town he lived in was not sufficiently large
      to give his genius a chance of being displayed to the full; and that was
      possibly why a short time afterwards he went to London and started
      business in one of the most central thoroughfares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within six months he was prosecuted for selling bogus Bechsteins,
      convicted, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence which at
      one time was a serious menace to the piano trade.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;TRICKS AND TRICKS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have heard it
      debated with great seriousness whether a fine art dealer in a commercial
      town, where the finer arts are neglected, is not entitled to resort to a
      method of disposing of his goods which some people might be disposed to
      term trickery. Personally, I think any form of trickery having money for
      its object is indefensible. But there are tricks and tricks, and what will
      be chuckled over by some businessmen as &ldquo;a good stroke of business&rdquo; may,
      if submitted to a jury, be pronounced a fraud, and it appears to me that
      people are becoming more exacting every day in their fine art dealings.
      They seem to expect that a picture dealer will tell them all he knows
      about any picture that he offers them, and, should they consent to buy it,
      that he will let them have it at the price he paid for it. Should they
      find out, after they have completed the purchase, that he made any
      statement to them that was not strictly accurate, they bring an action
      against him. How such people would be laughed at if they were to bring an
      action against the vendor of a patent medicine for having stated on the
      bottle that it would cure gout, neuralgia, and neuritis, when they had
      tried it and found that it would do nothing of the sort! There was a pill
      made during the eighteenth century which was guaranteed to prevent
      earthquakes. Some time ago I heard it seriously urged, on behalf of an
      American patent medicine, that when the half of San Francisco had been
      laid in ruins by an earthquake, the building where the medicine was
      manufactured remained undisturbed!
    </p>
    <p>
      But until recent years a pretty free hand was allowed to dealers in works
      of art. I remember being in a shop&mdash;called a gallery&mdash;in a
      provincial town in which a good deal of &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; in the picture way
      was effected. The proprietor had a drawerful of labels each bearing the
      name of a good old Master done in black on a gold ground, and when a work
      was &ldquo;restored&rdquo; to his satisfaction, he turned over the labels until he
      found one to suit its style. Then he nailed it very neatly on to the
      frame, and the picture was ready for sale as a Moroni, a Velasquez, a
      Tintoretto, or a Titian, as the case might be. The man was an excellent
      judge of pictures and prints, and I do not believe that he ever got a
      picture painted on an old canvas to sell as a genuine work. He simply
      bought all the good old pictures that he thought worth buying and &ldquo;touched
      them up.&rdquo; People bought them on chance, the wise ones asking no questions
      &ldquo;for conscience' sake&rdquo;&mdash;the conscience of the vendor; and I am pretty
      sure that many genuine pictures passed through his hands&mdash;some that
      were worth from a hundred to five hundred pounds apiece for a tenth of the
      smaller sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the humour of his labels better than anyone else, I think. He never
      gave an audible laugh when I used to inquire if he could provide me with a
      really choice Rembrandt for thirty shillings; he pretended to take me
      seriously, and, shaking his head, he would say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rembrandts with any pedigree are getting scarcer and scarcer every year,
      sir. You wouldn't feel justified in going as far as two pounds if you saw
      one that you took a fancy to, I suppose? No? Well, I'll see what I can do
      for you at your price, but I may tell you that it's rather below than
      above the figure for a genuine hand-painted Rembrandt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day two gentlemen called when I was in the gallery&mdash;a major in
      the Gunners and a brother officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said the former. &ldquo;I hope you got the frame in order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the dealer, bustling off to where a picture was lying
      with its face down on a bench. He picked it up and bore it to an easel, on
      which he placed it in a moderately good light. &ldquo;That's it, sir. I happened
      to lay my hands on a more suitable frame, so I didn't trouble with the old
      one; it's impossible to put a touch of gold leaf on an old frame without
      making it look patchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that's a far better frame than the old one,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;I
      brought my friend in to look at the picture. Who did you say it was by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubens, sir&mdash;an early Rubens, I think it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, that was the name. Looks well, doesn't it?&rdquo; said the officer to
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well indeed. I never saw anything that took my fancy better,&rdquo; said
      the other. &ldquo;Look at that silk&mdash;rippin', I call it&mdash;absolutely
      rippin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd like it,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;There's nothing looks so well
      in a room as a good old picture. But, of course, it's easy overdoing that
      sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing easier&mdash;like those American Johnnies,&rdquo; acquiesced his
      friend. &ldquo;Yes, a rippin' picture, I call that&mdash;good colour, you know,
      but all well toned down. Do you know what it is&mdash;I've a great mind to
      have one too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the major. &ldquo;You really couldn't do better, you know&mdash;six
      guineas, frame included.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're right. Yes, I'll take one too,&rdquo; said the other, turning
      to the dealer, who was standing silently by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the dealer. &ldquo;I'll look one out for you by to-morrow
      afternoon, if that would suit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suit me well. Six guineas in the frame, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, six guineas, unless&mdash;&mdash; Would you like a pair of
      them, sir? I might be able to take a little off for a pair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grave way in which he suggested a pair of Rubenses, as if it were
      customary to sell Rubenses in braces like pheasants, was too much for my
      nerves. I looked at my watch and made for the door, and I hope that I was
      well round the corner before I burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard afterwards that the officer had no use for a brace of Rubenses;
      but he bought a nice little Dutch village scene, by a painter named
      Teniers, for three pounds. It was not signed by the artist; but I have no
      doubt, if he had made a point of it, the dealer would have obliged him:
      the work of restoration frequently includes the restoring of an artist's
      signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was impressed on me that there is a humorous side even to picture
      dealing in the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      That incident, I repeat, took place in the good old days; but if one gives
      some attention to the law courts even nowadays one will find plenty to
      laugh at in connection with transactions in the fine arts. It was
      certainly very amusing to see some year or two ago, the examples of fine
      old Dresden which were displayed as &ldquo;exhibits&rdquo;&mdash;in the legal, not the
      exhibition, sense&mdash;in the law courts, all of which were pronounced
      spurious by the experts, though sold for many thousand pounds to a wealthy
      old tradesman, and to follow the story of every transaction. But I found
      it more amusing still to identify the various pieces with the
      illustrations contained in aback number of a leading magazine of art which
      had devoted several pages to a description of the magnificent Dresden
      collection of the old tradesman. What had been referred to as the gems of
      the cabinets were the very things that were produced in the Court as
      examples of the spurious!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
